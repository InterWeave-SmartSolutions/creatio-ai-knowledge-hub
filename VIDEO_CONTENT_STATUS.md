# Video Content Status Report

**Date**: August 1, 2025  
**Project**: Creatio AI Knowledge Hub

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Course Scraping**: Successfully scraped 33 courses from Creatio Academy
2. **Data Organization**: Organized content into structured directories
3. **Content Processing**: Converted HTML to Markdown, created indexes and
   summaries
4. **Backup Preparation**: Created cloud-ready backups with manifests
5. **Git Repository**: Initialized and prepared for GitHub sync

### ❌ Missing Video Content

#### Issue: No Embedded Videos Found

- All scraped video URLs point to generic YouTube channel:
  `https://www.youtube.com/c/creatio`
- No specific video IDs or embedded video URLs were captured
- No video transcripts available without actual video URLs

#### Possible Reasons:

1. Videos may be dynamically loaded via JavaScript (not captured by basic
   scraping)
2. Videos might require authentication to access
3. Videos could be hosted on a different platform or protected CDN
4. Course pages might load video content through AJAX after initial page load

## Required Actions for Video Content

### 1. Enhanced Video Detection

We need to implement:

- JavaScript rendering support (using Selenium or Playwright)
- Authentication-based scraping with logged-in session
- API endpoint discovery for video content
- Dynamic content loading detection

### 2. Video Processing Pipeline

Once videos are found, we need:

- Video download with yt-dlp or similar tools
- Audio extraction for transcription
- Whisper AI transcription
- Screenshot/thumbnail extraction
- Metadata preservation

### 3. Content Structure Expected

Based on the GitHub repository structure, we should have:

```
processed_content/
├── videos/
│   ├── video_id_title.mp4
│   ├── video_id_title.info.json
│   └── video_id_title.webp
├── transcripts/
│   ├── video_id_transcript.txt
│   └── video_id_detailed_transcript.json
└── ai_content_index.json
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps:

1. **Manual Investigation**: Log into Creatio Academy and manually check how
   videos are loaded
2. **Enhanced Scraper**: Develop a Selenium-based scraper that can:
   - Handle JavaScript-rendered content
   - Maintain authenticated sessions
   - Wait for dynamic content to load
3. **API Discovery**: Look for API endpoints that serve video content
4. **Contact Creatio**: Consider reaching out to Creatio for API access or bulk
   content export

### Alternative Approaches:

1. Use browser automation to navigate each course while logged in
2. Capture network requests to find direct video URLs
3. Export browser session cookies for authenticated scraping
4. Check if Creatio offers an official API for content access

## Current Repository State

- Total files: 199
- Total size: ~1.8MB (excluding large files)
- Ready for GitHub sync
- Missing: Video files, transcripts, and screenshots

## Next Phase Requirements

To complete the knowledge hub as specified in the GitHub repository:

1. Obtain actual video URLs from courses
2. Download all videos with metadata
3. Generate transcripts using Whisper AI
4. Create searchable content index
5. Build MCP server for AI agent interaction
