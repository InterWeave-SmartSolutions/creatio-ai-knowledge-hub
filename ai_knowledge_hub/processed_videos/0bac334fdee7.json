  "transcript": " Today is session number six of our development on creation platform guided learning. Today I want you to see some additional materials related to classic UI and freedom UI and migration. And then we will fully switch to work with server side. So recently we managed to create a fully separate classic UI solution. And this was a classical section and list inside of this is called also it's called a section list. So we have a set of data records here. When you open edit page, you see classic UI edit page with columns components. And we decided not to focus too much on classic UI because this platform will be like a deprecated probably somewhere in future. Currently it's supported, currently it's working. But in future so it will be not developed, it will be not improved. We will not see new tools or components for the classic like and most development is focused on freedom UI. And you also remember some interesting feature. Some feature for voice recognition, you remember we still missed it in free the UI. You also can do details, you can program buttons for actions, everything is explained at Academy. So if you ever need it, you can look at it. Also if you go to client module part for classic UI, you will see that code in classic UI in general is I think a bit more simple than in freedom UI. Because in classic UI you can also make your items in deep array, for example, like a button, we will do it later. Then you can create a handler as a function at methods section. And in general, I think it's easier because more transparent work with object model, more transparent operation is bigger model data. I will show you more examples later and this is just a quick brief introduction for you. If you work with some freedom your classic pages, in this case, this possibly can help you. So what I want to show today, this will be a very typical task for future, I think. And this typical task is your customer who already runs some classic UI section successfully. And customer understands the future is in freedom UI, customer wants to use some free UI features tools components and pretty looking user interface. So customer asks you to migrate some existing solutions from classic UI to freedom UI. Fortunately, we don't have any automated procedures for this. And especially this, the concept is not a complex if you have some program to code in classic UI. So I will show you the most practical way, how you can switch from classic UI to freedom UI. I will also show you some settings and system settings for this, which impact on how you see your system. So you will be more experts in it, how to make this migration. So as my example, I have a real to classic section implemented as classic UI. And I will show you how we can switch it in freedom UI and what we have to do for this. So freedom UI or classic UI, the only difference is at client side. So we have different types of client modules. Such items which have section in their name or page in their name, they usually design as classic UI. If you look at the pages and you see form page or list page, it's a freedom UI. Of course, physically they are totally different when you go to this page, you will see page editor. Like this, it's a freedom UI page. And when you will go, for example, to a section page, you will see only code. Because it's classic UI and you can configure a classic UI sections only when you go to corresponding section and run section wizard in it. That's how you can get to page editor in classic UI. But now our task is to make an example of migration and the source part, we have classic section, this one. And as expected result, we would like to make one more section, but showing the same data in freedom UI. Several side part, for example, we have objects, we have maybe some server side logic, maybe we have some business processes. So server side part will remain the same. Data items, look up contents, everything will be the same. The only change we expect to do will be our user interface area, so set of client modules and awaited code that is defined such items. So I will show you how to migrate from classic UI section to a freedom UI section. Please note that it will not necessary to forever forget about the city lights, still possible. And different users may define themselves, which type of user interface they want to run. So it will be possible to switch. First of all, I need to tell you about some important settings related to such view. And I would like you to see this background like frame, you see this name, which shows you some kind of something see background image, some kind of item, which is called desktop. And you can select and edit it. And the left part you see set of sections, workplaces, you see for different workplaces, different contents. And you also can see some image background and the top line here also use set of buttons items, which are designed in Angular and they are items of freedom UI. So this left and top area is managed by freedom UI and we can switch this background frame setting to classic UI if we want. So let me show you system settings and this system setting is called like, use freedom UI interface. This setting generally turns on or off this background frame stuff. And if we just for test purpose went to turn it off. So use freedom UI interface was originally on. We turned it off and it's cashed. So in order to apply this, we will need to log out and log in again. Now you will see how system will look like with a classic UI set of section and the top top search bar. Now you see system, how it looked when we had no freedom UI. You see a bit difference here, you see that we still have different works workplaces. It looks like we totally miss workplace, which is based on freedom UI. We miss workplace with customers 360 from here, as you can see. And we can also go to workplace management system designer this page. Go to workplace setup. Let's check our customers 360 workplace. And you see use only in shallow in like in usual words. If we want to translate it into something that you can easily understand, it means that use only in freedom UI background settings. Now it's not freedom UI, it's classic UI, that's why this workplace disappeared. So you can manage how you would like to see background, which is a classic or freedom UI. So we can go back because we're interested in migration now. So we need to enable freedom UI back use the UI interface, open it, set it again, save it, close it. Yes, let's log out and log in again to see back our background to freedom UI setting, which is default setting now. And which is recommended to work with freedom UI sections and also some classic sections. It still support you see we have freedom UI background, but we have classic UI stuff inside of what I wanted you to know next is special section design to simplify. Such transition between classic UI and freedom UI sections and user interface. Now you see special section special setting for page which is called UI management. And we can specify setting for freedom UI for different roles or users. Which makes possible to do it quite flexible. For example, some users are really really tick to some classic UI solutions. They are not ready to switch to freedom UI. They work with some basic UI sections and it's critical importance for them. So you can manage the stuff for different users. And also we have form page preferences, which is also designed to simplify the selection between freedom UI and classic UI. And only in case if both options are enabled for a section. So this case is saved by default, freedom UI uses freedom pages, press secure uses classic pages by default. And we have some exceptions for this. But personally, I consider this stuff as overcomplicated. And once you started to migrate from classic UI to freedom UI, I think that it's better to finish this migration and then do not use classic UI and only invest into freedom UI. So this is a page which will be temporarily important for you. And finally, you will switch to freedom UI all your necessary business sections. And then you will feel quite okay with it. So you will not really need to switch back to classic UI. And that's how I recommend you to follow this personally in our inner Academy department in creation company. We still use some classic UI solutions, but our plan is to migrate to freedom UI and then to use only freedom UI sections. So this stuff like page for settings will be temporary useful for you. Okay, let's go back. So finally, we have currently for classic section. We only have classic user interface. So we have no option to display freedom UI pages. So how we do this? How we can make a migration? I will explain it right now. I will show you, I think, the easiest way. So let's go to settings. Then go to application hub. So we can create new ads. As you remember, application is like a new top level setting core of like a. So we have a new application name to T, which may include one or several packages inside. We already have freedom UI for the section, but we don't have any classic representation for it. So when we create new application, we will create new package. We will create. If we ask it will create new section for us. So now I will show you how we can create new application. We can call it. We can make it based on records and business processes. But we will name it. Reality migration. So it means that we migrate from classic UI to freedom UI. We can compose kind of icon for it. And we will use this very important feature linked and existing object. This is very important. So this is a key feature of all this migration idea. We will use existing reality. Classic UI. Main reality classic entity. This one will be main. And it will mean that system will not create new object for us. It will use existing object. It will create a new package. It will save all our application information into new package. And we will make dependency from real to classic existing. Dev. Classic package. And finally we will have new app. But based on existing object. And let's try. Let's create it. Icon cover is okay for me. So let's move it. This will be not so hard because system didn't create new objects for us. It only uses existing object. So we will create several clients module. So I don't expect it to last longer than 20 seconds. So let's see how it works for us. And then you will see the main idea of migration. So generally it's pretty simple. You will have a new app. You will have template or list. And or edit page. And you will have to manually set it up according to our expectations. So you can see there is almost no automation. Such migration. Unfortunately. And the word of hand work is expected here. So let me show you how we can do this. So we have data models. Our data model has no new object. But it definitely has an existing object because it's maybe based on. This real to okay, let's go to easy part list page. I think is easy part. And. It shows some columns. We can hide unnecessary columns. We can add the columns that we need. You now you see all our classic object columns are here. So we can specify. Okay, we want to see main. Price. Type over type and comment and then date of creation order of selection is important here. And we can hide this column. We can also hide this. We can shrink. We can move something if necessary. We can swap columns positions if you want. So now this is easy part. We only made our list settings for freedom. You know, I page. Physically this page is saved. Let me show you. This page. We page here. Is saved into new package. And it's parent. Page is somewhere in template. Code and title. It's quite good. So we can save it. No problem. I prefer to control what's going on at configuration section. Because probably I'm too stick to development. And I don't really trust only. No code tools. So I always want to check what is going on there. And that's why we go to corresponding new created package. And you see the package must have dependency from that. Dev classic. Yes. Has it. And this package. Now includes no own objects. So it uses existing object from parent package from dev classic. And you see no created objects here. So we did not customize our object model so far. So we use 100% of all existing columns from classic object. So data model is the same user interface part is the only change here. And we have list page changes. Now I work with four pages. So list changes. Okay. Now let's work with form page. Form page is 3Wi edit page for a section for an object. And the as you can see it has its own properties. And our package code title rate. And we can specify columns as we wish. We already have all the classic icons. So we only can just drag them at its ways where we expected to work with. So let's go and display types. This is list of existing columns. So such columns were already added at the stage where we created in in classic. We have comment. We don't have any other columns. It could be useful. Also it's interesting to mention that you see such a. Such notes here representing that column was already added to the page. So you will see such note if. So you will see such note if. Column was already shown somewhere and you will not see it. If column is present in your object model, but was not shown on the page here. Knowns, for example, the column which is designed to work with attachments. And that's why it was not shown a separate component here. And I do not plan to show it. Okay. So in general, it looks like this. So try to specify drop down for types. Drop down for for types. Okay. Great. We did not create manager for this object. And when we finished, you can just click save. As you can see, even if we had some business logic in classic. This business logic is not automatically migrated into freedom. But it's still big difference between such platforms and code that now developers did not implement any kind of automation. And transition or business logic that is designed in classical and you want to see the same in the video. So if such logic exists, you will have to re-program it working at code source code part of the client module. So I already saved it. You can close it. Now you see some changes. You can control what's going on at our package. And that's how we can test out work. So I expect to see new sections. Somewhere here migration section. Now you see the data which previously was shown in classic UI. Also available in freedom UI user interface. You can try to add the new data record. But now you see still you see classic UI page. This is result of some browser cache issues. Okay, let's cancel this. Log out. Log in. Go to freedom UI section. Also, I would like it to be present in my. Let me show you in my studio workplace. So let's go to workplace studio. I'd like to add my migration migrated section. We will find it. Reality migration only sections which were not present here are shown. That's why only real to migration is shown because reality and real to classic are already done. Okay, migration is somewhere at the end. So we arrange this as usual and move it up. Just below the class. We can also bind this workplace and save it to the same package where we originally saved it. And system creates corresponding three different data items for us. Okay, we trust that everything saved correctly. So we have three sections now. So studio reality, reality classic and migration is somewhere at the end of the world. I expect to see my sections on their places. Yes, reality is our new freedom UI original setting. Classic is our classic UI original stuff. The migration is our classic UI data shown in freedom UI user interface trying to open the edit page shows us freedom UI page for migrated stuff. So now we made our example with migration and we successfully implemented it's in user interface. So you see that this is a simple simple and quite straightforward way of how you can do this migration. You will have more difficulties with transferring all business logic making your own filters again. If you made some filters for drop downs, for example, in classic UI, it's possible to use programming or to use business rules and business rules are not my graded automatically. So you will have to implement the same settings that you made for classic UI again manually at freedom UI pages. But haven't the data stuff the same. It's a tool doesn't take too much time because your data is data model is ready. And what is interesting, we have special parts of sections like folders, like tags and nodes. So nodes will be taken correctly from classic UI part. You will see attachments here and nodes is a special component which is missing here. That's why you did not see it. But files will be shown here. So in classic UI special component to show your files is called this detail. Now it's failed. Because we probably. So as you can see, it's quite hard to make it work at the same time where you work with classic UI and freedom UI. So it's really hard to now is switched to freedom UI and that's why classic UI edit page is not working normally. But for different users, it's possible to set up. So you can see in classic UI, I open the page and I see freedom UI edit page because my current setting is to show freedom UI page. And because of freedom UI shell is activated. So you see this background top panel and left panel are in freedom UI. And because we see some background here. And because it's made on anger. So edit page was chosen to be shown in freedom UI even though we opened it from a section which is in classic UI. So I understand this is kind of messy with different types of UI. So finally, when you do migration, you will use this health of application hub. You will get new package for your migrated stuff from classic to freedom. You have set up quite modules and all logic that you miss, you can implement with the help of business roles, with the help of components that are available is no code tools at freedom UI and not available is no code tools in classic UI. And also you will be able to write your code for migrated pages to implement the same functionality that you needed and that you previously used in classic sections. So if you have any questions about this migration, this time, server side part like business processes like web services like a sound C sharp code is the same. So it operates with data model, it doesn't really depend on the type of user interface. So server side part of your migrated stuff will be the same and you just need to check that it still works as expected. In case of any questions, I will be happy to hear. As usual video recording is performed. So if you missed some part or if you know, so just watch this later on the videos will be available. Panty, yes, questions. Yeah, I have a question is really sorry, not really. It's classic UI ever. Is it would it still be the, um, deployed to new customers, or is it just mainly targeted towards legacy customers? So currently we position classic UI as still like working to, but you do not recommend to create new solutions on it. So it's like you have an old PC and new PC and you think about installing some problem. Of course it makes sense to install it on new PC unless you have very serious reasons to use classic UI for it. So you already have some marketplace add on, which is very useful for your business, but implemented in classic UI and is expected to be used in some classic section. So if you have some strong reasons like you stock with some classic solutions, then it makes sense to continue its development to improve it to advertise to your customers. So if you have like equal chances and new customer and new project, of course it makes sense to look at freedom your first because in freedom you have in like in several times more available no code controls components and freedom UI will be developed in future and its support is going on. So the new PC UI is now supported on the poor existing components, no new components are created for classic UI. We still have thousands of customers with running classic UI solutions and it is quite good. So customers are happy with running what they have, but it's about future it's about development and improvements in future. So if you have choice. So if you want to choose select freedom UI, if you don't have choice because of existence or circumstances, then you can decide yourself and choose a classic, if you do some customizations. Thanks, Melia. Thank you, thank you for your question. Okay, so now you know how to do first steps. Actually, we also faced the same stuff in our inside like team work and automation inside of creation. We have several big creation based solutions inside of creation company and it's also so we also like face as most of our customers with face such upgrade needs because freedom UI is now primary user interface and we still have a lot of classic UI legacy. So we do some plan work on improvements from classic UI to freedom UI and we still work with some sections in classic UI because of too many systems too many changes to be performed. And one day we plan to switch from classic UI to freedom UI in most of our currently used sections and we have some tools as I showed you that intended to help you with it. Personally, I think that once you started to switch, it's better to make it quick and then to continue improvements already in freedom UI. So not to be too long in this intermediate stage where some users are working in classic others are working in freedom. You will have double time or support of this intermediate stage. So we have to try to make it shorter and to implement something like minimum value product in your freedom UI, move your users there and then improve quickly improve on necessary remaining things that will make your users for the happens. So not to stay long in this intermediate stage. Okay, so if you have some real life examples, some kind of practical interest and practical experience with migration also tell me it's interesting what you think of it what unexpected outcome you have probably. So anyone I think may have something unusual and expected and even in creation, we sometimes can implement all possible scenarios. So if you will have something unusual, just tell me I will try to help with it. So we have to switch from our client side probably already get tired of it to some server side features. I will try to explain and to make this transition quite smooth. And now we will talk about more developed oriented things and more related to programming at creation server side in C sharp using dot net framework and talking about compilation libraries file system and so on. So probably I have to start that in any package. Now we see we have some set of items of different types. So we have items with different types. If you try to add an item manually, you know, we'll see we have objects and we also studied what is replacing object. We have pages so client modules of different types and also we have repubescent, your model, which means replacing client module, specially designed to extend and modify existing pages. And there we already studied this one. We did not study source code, we will do it a bit later and we slightly touched the question on making business process. So I need to show you. I need to show you some items and explain where they are actually stored and how they actually work. So when you operate with objects, we already know that it doesn't solve object server side item, but it's changes are applied easily without need to compile. So generally C sharp code is not so let's say heavily used for objects and replace not. Of course C sharp source code if you design it separately in source code item will definitely require some compilation. So it means that when you develop something inside of item name source code, you will not be able to immediately start it. You need to run a special procedure code compilation and physical it means that creation. And those some C sharp sources at server side and when you want to apply them and when you want to implement and apply changes so you will need to compile and see and creation is capable to collect C sharp sources, but it's compilable part finally to compile and get executable DLL libraries and then use such libraries at its website. So C sharp sources definitely require compilation all JavaScript part this all this JavaScript part obviously does not require compilation because it's a set of JavaScript files. They are executed as interpreted code at browser side. So when you save and apply any change in JavaScript part in client module part also does not require any compilation. So this is interpreted part fully business processes in general such items as business process. It's designed as interpreted setting but for some processes you can add the C sharp code and make it compilable. So in some processes, let's say we have plus minus it means that some processes can include compilable code and we can run it and we can use such advantage of compilation and very fast execution. But it's not mandatory in general it's recommended to have as less as possible for code in your processes because processes are originally designed to be a no code tool and possibility to code into it. It's not its primary purpose. The primary purpose of a process is to make a business logic as set of steps that you can easily construct with using of your mouse and which will not require programming and then you can get your business work done. But you can also use C sharp code inside of it and that's why we can call business processes as partly compilable. So I will show you example rest and swap services they do not require compilation because mainly they are metadata used inside of business processes and user task is a C sharp program item that requires compilation. Now as well scripts obviously are not compiled items data is also metadata node compiled and import we can import DLL items if they are written in dot net and add them to our packages and use them in our compile. So in general such DLLs if we import them are included into compilation so we can consider this stuff as involved in compilation. Now you see only four types of items that somehow touch the compilation and in general. In general that's how we can say that creation has compilable server set also probably also need to tell you that objects can potentially include its compile but now it's not recommended to be used and doing general this is feature that still supported but probably will not use it. We will talk about object programming and possibility to use C sharp compilable old there when we'll talk about event handling at object level so in general C sharp sources for sure some business processes and user tasks they are compiled and finally they are turned into what they are turned into DLLs that you can find in bin folder here or you can also find DLLs as result of compilation in many packages for example we made the classic package files bin and here is our DLL of a package compiled as separate assembly. So why you need to understand such files DLLs pencil out because now we will talk about server size functionality and you need to know how it turns into something that system can execute where you have to search for some sources and you need to wait understand it in very general thing so you will know where to find some parts of execution executable. executable, executable stuff of creation. We will make an example now and I think that the easiest possible way to demonstrate how you can write and run C sharp code at the workshop platform is to make a business process which will execute C sharp script task into it. I intentionally avoid making our own C sharp sources at the beginning so first I plan to show you how we can make process with some piece of programming inside of it. We need some package for this I prefer to do it in my realty package this is program your I solution so one of our main packages here in total now you see we have three packages in our solution and it's not the answer possibly we may have more if you want you can also minimize number of packages if you play with you remember we studied it with the search rack set. If you are looking for a package in installed application it's possible to minimize number of existing packages for you if you connect all your editable applications with some packages if you already have and we already did it avoiding creating one more package for customer C 60 customization. This is something that we already studied you know how to find it just to find and register an object named packaging install application as a lookup lookup section then you will be able to handle all your applications or your packages included there and you can replace your package for some apps making system saving your application customization into certain package. Okay so what I plan to do now select my three don't you write you as a realty package and the business process I need to explain that what business process is because some of you probably already have experience with customization and some of you probably already know that business process is a server side functionality which is designed to automate some business steps that you expect to be performed by system and in general business processes are interpreted. It means you construct such kind of diagram and then ask system to run it system will read your diagram structure step by step and it will execute your diagram step by step so in general business process is saved as set of metal data settings technically the text with all necessary information about its structure and we have a special process engine so it's a backend server side item quite important very big which is capable to get such metadata and executed step by step according to the diagram items. Okay let's start so I need to provide a code you are and I need to explain the business sense of my future process my business sense will include some calculations and also I will work with database so I also plan to connect and to use one example for different purpose and this example will be used not only to demonstrate how you can run C sharp code in creation but also to demonstrate how you can write some code that operates with the creation database and which operates with the creation data model using its own native tools for this. I will explain it later so my business sense is to make a process which will do some calculation at server side and my calculation will include selecting some data and calculating average price for realty record. So my process name will be something like Koch average realty price process and the title of the process will be calculated average realty price. Please confirm do any of you follow me directly at the session or you just watch it as video and then you plan to do your own steps. It's important for me to know how long delays I should provide for you and how I should make poses or not so if you follow me just live during the session please click please type plus in our chat if you let me understand that I have to make poses for you to do the same during the session. If not just type minus which means you are only watching and I can do it faster. Okay thank you thank you Monica Adren. Thank you to Sher. Okay it looks like someone from you also following me so I will not go too fast. Now I made a process with a title and the code. Now any other changes and went to save it in my USR realty package which is used for freedom UI examples. It also makes sense to name my beginning of the process we could like start and here we will have successful finish so normal and call the process. Okay save it. As you can see first time it takes takes a while to save it but in general now our process represents a diagram which has a starting point. Generally process will start from all items which have no incoming flows so if your process has no incoming flow it means that it's a start of your process. So take care if you accidentally drop items on your diagram without incoming flows it will be treated as a beginning so please be careful. Okay so my plan is to show you not all the process engine tools but only developer part of it so part where it makes sense to write code and include some what say developer skills into your product. Because also business process engine and general process editor has a lot of no code tools which we will also use but without explaining all the all the possible functions so I will show you only major things that we will need for our example. My main focus today is to show you items that are included in development in general you know that business process editor has two types of items that you can add system actions which are executed quite quick they've not required user feedback and they are repeated automatically at server side. So we have items called user actions user actions are designed to show some page or user usually waiting for some feedback after it and user actions are designed to stop your process execution for some time till user will respond something till user will provide some input or will confirm that. So user actions will make your process much more interactive okay we have some other types of items like starting events intermediate events finishing event and logical gateways so I will show you only developer part of it which you need to know if you're really interested in. Become in a process expert you can also consider going to our customization course where my colleagues teach how to manage processes. So what my plan is I use user I use system action script task the only item in all business process which requires coding in this diagram. So this item should be carefully put on the diagram I can intentionally show you how you can do it incorrectly like this then you move it like this and then it looks like you added this item to the diagram but in reality this is not correct I will show you that this item does not say connect to this flow and if you do it like this. This item has no incoming flow so it will be started at the process beginning not as your plan and that's why you should take care of it and put it properly now you see when you slightly move it then you correctly put it on the flow so you should practice a bit with placing items on the diagram and making sure that you do it correctly now this item has incoming flow it has its own. It's on the sharp body and we have some notes here but it's only for one last in operation and then we have finished so what we can do here this is a C sharp script that physically will turn into a method of automatically generated class. The C sharp is capable to generate some C sharp sources for it and then it's capable to compile them so now you will see that we can write some C sharp code here and then save reply changes for our process and it will turn into automatically generated class and our code here in this C sharp script will turn into a method. It will not take too much time for us because I already have some redeveloped examples for you and it will be server side and it is came up for a calculation so I already have some example which will work for us probably I should paste it into our chat and paste it for you because it's what big as we put it into parts because zoom has some limitations on chat messages size so we can take chat messages probably we will slightly need to replace names here like this but you will see it. So I copy and paste this code to the editor. We can also expand this editor to see you like in more comfortable ways and if you will ask me about is it possible to use modern powerful editors like Visual Studio or Visual Studio code to type code like this. Unfortunately for business processes it's not intended to be so it's not supported and for business process says writing a short code here in this editor in general it's okay so you will not suffer too much by writing just 10 or 20 lines of such code but if your plan includes to run very complex calculations and put in different classes including a lot of other things libraries and tools it makes sense to implement complicated logic separately you can use C-sharp source code for it and then just to create corresponding instances of your classes probably also using tools tool called class factory and you may create instances of classes that will work as helpers for you then you can just make corresponding settings and run corresponding methods. That's how you may keep this code quite small sized and do not need to create very complicated logic just here so it was not intended to be used or complicated logic. It was created with ideas of using of existing classes and making this code not so big so if you need big logic please implement it separately as a normal classes with source codes where you will be able to use Visual Studio to develop so you will have comfortable conditions for it. Here it's not so comfortable I agree this editor is not so powerful but you can bypass this advantage because I'm not writing too much code here. Okay so I will save my code example it's not finished yet I will just show you what happens if you try to save so if you have a changes in your script task and you save your process system asks you to compile here publish means start compilation and I do not plan to do it right now because my code needs some improvement and I need to explain what is going on and explain you step by step what is happening here so in general I need to explain you like common idea of what we are doing the common idea is run a business process which will accept some arguments at the beginning and then we will do calculation of average reality price based on our existing data. But as you may guess working with realty data we have different types of data records let me show you a bit more examples like apartment and. Do you want to do an apartment for sale? Okay it should be rewarded probably I just say okay it's apartment and this also is an apartment for sale so what I wanted to show you we have different types of reality like houses in apartment they have different pricing values they have different pricing models so it's not good in general to be able to do it. We have different offer types like sale and rental which are totally different so it's totally incorrect to mix values for rental monthly payments and full cost of some realty records so it's not correct to mix them and try to calculate some average price between them. So we have to do quite smart filtering we need to take into consideration only records with a certain type in order to split apartments from houses and definitely we have to filter data according to offer type splitting sales from rentals so when we do this average price calculation we will need to have filters or offer type to include only rentals or only sales and general realty type to include only apartments or only houses and then we will calculate total amount of all all selected records total price then we will divide by total area of them in order to include and consider different areas for different objects so we will count in general we will count. In general we will count like average price of a real to per square foot of the area and that is how we will finally get our result so the real sense is just counting similar objects and getting average price to our area and physically how we do this. This is the C sharp code written in this editor and yes I agree that if you don't know C sharp it could be quite hard for you to write it without mistakes so if you type some code here if it has mistakes system will not show it immediately for you. But if you write something like this with a missing name of your method so if you do some mistake with standing then you will note about it so you will know about this mistake only when you start to compile. Unfortunately there is no big ground syntax check that will show you with a red color that you have some mistakes here in this text but it's designed to be quite small and it should be quite of us so we do not think that it's a real issue. Okay so let me explain in general what is happening here I plan to operate with creation database we have two different ways to operate with the database and now I'm using the approach which supports entity data model simply speaking it supports items like objects and respect object structure object. Colleants and references and everything that we design at creation or object relational object relational model or M of creation is based on objects and we can design them when we say even publish object structure is applied to the real database tables and columns so that's how it works and working with this class entities. This is a clear class means making selections of data records from creation data model respecting objects respecting all their column structure so using this information another approach which will study bit later is based on direct database selection from its tables without use of object model. We will be able to write down our own selects some columns from some tables where some conditions without taking care of support of object model but now this approach shows you this possibility with support of object model and this is one of two major approaches to get data there are some advantages of using such approach and it supports access rights restrictions. If this code is running under single user credentials it's possible that user will have no enough access rights to operate with data so if you run your data selection with entity level with support of object model so it will restrict restrictions it will read no data if such data is not available according to access rights. The entity schema clear supports caching server side if the same data is obtained too many times as a server side it's possible to organize your code in the way that this data was first obtained from the database and all second times it may be will update will be taken from the server side application cache and that's how you may do your selections more efficient. So entity schema clear supports caching also it's a poor it supports paging when you need to process very big set of data records and you prefer to do it by parts working with portions of data pages and entity schema clear also supports complex query structures including hierarchical queries that makes sense when you operate some data which can be displayed in three views. Okay let's not go too hard and too deep so currently simple answer entity schema puree is a class which supports object model and it has only one single purpose select list of records from the database it has some arguments when we run its constructor we have several overloaded constructors for this class and it has arguments one of them is quite standard. So you will always use it and second argument is a text representing our object code as you remember our code is us are realty so we have to correspondingly modify this one. So you should do this at your own I will also note it in chat and this is how we can create an instance of our class which will be used for data selection of our entity schema query we have to specify its settings we have to make it work properly for us. So we need first to select columns also you may ask me if we type this code like this how we know about present functions methods properties and so on we have some academy server side documentation let me show you the canned development dot net classes reference go here and we have set of classes libraries for creation server side you can search for entity schema query class here you will see all of its definitions structures. So you will see all of its constructors one two three four four different overloaded constructors and using this one third one and we have a lot of public properties with the whole you will see public methods and so on. So if interested you may find this SDK information at academy and we'll go back to our code I agree. Currently it looks like a bit boring stuff so we try to go through it quite quickly we only make sure that we have the same columns as we plan to work with and we don't have any obvious road mistakes here so let's look at our reality object just to match our columns we need to select price and it's not going to be a lot of work. Here we have usr price usd column and you is our area okay so it looks like the same we can add the columns to our query you may also face a method named add all schema columns but I strongly warn you from using this method because when you add all schema columns may happen that you are working with the quite big entity with hundreds of columns. And without thinking you can add a lot of columns which you will never use later in your code so it's better to save system resources and do not all end all the columns until you really needed. So it's better to always and only columns into your selection which you really need to analyze the way to in my case I need to columns price and area. And making such methods to our entities schema query rule result into adding couple of columns so the part of our selection statement that will finally start at the database will look like select and set of columns that we do from our real tea table from this table this table is called. root entity which is the first one which will be used for construction of our query it's possible to use joins and add other columns to our selection. But in my case I need just a very simple example of the only one table in general it's possible to make joins with other entities and in my case it's just not necessary but it's possible you can use this argument as a special column path expression column path may include joins if you use look up columns of your main entity. In this case it's called direct join or if you use look up columns of joined entity in this case construction will be a bit more complicated and it's called reverse joins if interested you can show you where I can get more information about this or programming so let me show you database. second now it's about architecture. to advance data operations direct access or review yes somewhere here so we have roots schema which is the main from table of our select statement and it's possible to add connections to other entities and using direct connections when you select city you can join to the sanctuary countries to get its name or you can use reverse connections where you can use the name. So when you have account and you would like to or in this case it looks like you select cities and you would like to join all accounts from this city. And so this article will let you know more about it something like theoretical stuff in my case it's pretty simple so I will select only one table one couple of columns from this table no joins at all. So here is how I do this but then I will need filters because my plan is to select only data for a certain realty type and certain offer type. I plan to get corresponding values for my filters with the help of no code tools so I expect to get such values I will show you how to produce process parameters a bit later. Now we consider we getting it with a special get comments from process parameters so we get a couple of good things for type and offer type and then we make filters such filters are made with the create out of this parameter method which I think the most popular method for building filters for entities schema puri and this filter conditions pretty simple column equals value. And finally our where statement will look like this column equals one value and another column equals another value by default logical condition to join all the filters we have in filter collection is logical and that's why we do not modify it because we know for sure that by default our is filters has end. And the logical connection logical conjunction operator. That's why we have it without any special set so if you want only for debugging purpose you can get a skill text from your query so it's possible it's supported you can get a skill text and we can save it and then to use it for some display but only for debugging purpose especially in like. Especially highlight this for you because for real execution you do not actually need this skill text it will work even without your asking of skill and this is just for your better understanding of how selection is performed so this will be necessary only for debugging for us. So when we finished with building entities schema puri adding columns and adding filters we can consider it as it's done and we can run the main function for selecting data this is get entity collection method which. Finally returns as some collection also you may notice that we use special arguments here here and here and this argument is called user connection this is very important instance of a class which represents current user connection context so user connection is unique for each user session. Even if you have supervisor user and you start your system twice for example in two different browsers you will have two different user connection instances for this. So user connection has a lot of useful properties like current user name current user ID current user contact and some system stuff like information about database connection some security staff which is also important to know so generally when we use user connection in our code it represents current user context and this is mandatory. So create with creation database so each time when you will run any kind of query that you want to be finally operating with your database you will have to provide user connection because this one is like in general what do you plan to select but user connection is an important argument which tells the system who exactly is running this. This query system will include access rights permissions if necessary if this user is not an administrator so user connection is a very important context information for system and it's mandatory for any database related operation okay we finally got our collection as a result. This result is set of records each one represents an entity class entity represents one single data row of a certain object and as we get this collection we have to process it line by line so we can use for each statement or there are other ways to process collection. In my case I prefer to use for each and we use it for each row or as many rows we have in collection we will have as many runs of our cycle body inside of our cycle we can have this entity reference which implements just one data row of the collection and we can run so this entity record is actually a support and interface called entity identity and that's why it has methods so we can run methods like get typed on value get typed column value let's us to get certain value of a certain column from our data row. So simply speaking this is the line how we get exact decimal price from our data and next line is getting the same approach or getting decimal area. We have some counters here which we use to collect all the prices and all the areas this example is pretty simple and so I'm just going into so many details only for those of you who probably have not so much experience of C-share so you will understand in general how it works and you'll be able to reproduce it and fix it if something goes wrong. Finally when we finished we'll have counter or prices and for areas and then total result will be a result of division of all the prices by all the areas and we will have a final result and we will save it into certain parameters. Currently it looks like our code is ready we don't have corresponding parameters so far so possibly we have to implement it and then save and publish but it looks like we need some like say I for 10 minutes or break. So let's make it break. And then we'll continue this stuff and you will see that finally it's not so boring and I will also show you how to debug such code today. So let's make a break if you have any questions in the break also please know please type them or just ask I will come back in less than 10 minutes. Thank you for waiting let's move on and now we have to think of how to actually use this code into our process so we have this part and we fixed all the items here now we have to think of parameters. C sharp sources inside of business processes can get some data from process interpreted part and then returns some data into processes interpreted part the best way to do this is to use parameters. So parameters can be considered as a variables for the process and process items also may have their own parameters so in general we can think of parameters as global variables for the process or for certain values of process items. I plan to work with a global process parameters and we need some of them like real the type ID so we plan to register such parameter as unique identifier code is used inside of programming title can be used for user interface settings in process diagram that's why you spoke. So title and code I copied it from the code so here I use this one and when we use get generic expression and getting good value and this parameter as an argument we ask system to read corresponding parameter value from the process and also we will do with the offer type. I called its name show you go to process parameters also I need to explain if you click on some process item it will show you selected item properties if you click on the block or if you click on this green button it will see process properties. I prefer to click on the block because it's easier and parameters and unique identifier offer type ID we need it as arguments for our code. Okay couple of arguments already then I went to return back debug ask your text parameter so it will be text 500. So creating parameters you like decoey and variables for the process and the final result will be my average price parameter and it will be decimal so add decimal parameter. And I hope you are quite good in doing it so my question is for Monica and Paddy please confirm when you when you finish this part. We create couple of guides you may identify one text 500 and one decimal. Monica and Paddy please confirm when you're ready with this thank you Monica. Thanks Paddy okay great so we can move on so we plan to use such parameters but also I will tell you that. Unfortunately we have so fortunately we have the ability to run process as a no code tool with no programming from section list or section page in the read in for the UI and unfortunately we can only pass one single value as an argument so my plan is to use as much as possible of no code here. And for example we can select a certain record or we can open certain page then I plan to make a button which will run the process but unfortunately we can only pass one single data value as argument when running no code parameter process so. In no code mode we can only pass ID of the current list like record and argument and I plan to use it in my process so my plan is to get this ID then to use no code tools to select correspond to data values from the database and then to provide correspond to parameters set so as example in my case in my parameters I plan to get an input process parameter. And we can name it realty ID it will be also unique identifier. So we can call it realty ID parameter and here it's title will be a realty ID title is important for user display and code is important for programming. And we can set this parameter as input parameter input parameter will be designed as read only so process expects is dated to be set at the beginning of the process when process is called and it's not expected to be changed it so input parameters will be treated as read only you will not be able to save its changes. We have no initial value so we expect this data to be provided from input you can see that input parameters on the one single red green covered arrow and the directional parameters are used with two sides arrows and green and red. Okay so we expect to get this realty ID what will we do with this ID how we use a bit of no code tools read read data item carefully placing it on my diagram you see there is a special display when you put it properly. Okay my read data item will be used to get ID of type and over time so read first record of selection okay what object realty object which is a freedom you are example. In reading one single record it makes sense to make filtering otherwise we will randomly get some data record and we want to get corresponding roles one. So I will make a filter click here add condition type ID for comparison equals with parameter. And I will select my process parameter realty ID this is and then click select or double click here that's how I will make this filter this filter will be enough to make read data to select just single record from my database and we can name it read reality read reality will be it's title it will be also shown here in general good idea to provide corresponding titles for all of your items. And no need to sort if we have just one record and read all columns I do not recommend you to use a option so reading all columns means you don't care how many columns will be there and in some cases it can happen that you will have too many columns so it will mean that you are necessary word your system with hearing of all the data you have so it's much better to set. To date only for selected columns only and we can specify what columns we are interested in we are interested in type and offer type so originally we expect to get only ID of the certain realty record then we will look into database to get its type and offer type. And then we will use read data item to get such type and offer type once we obtain it when processes started results of such data records will be saved somewhere inside of this read data item it turned out to be not very easy to get it outside from it with programming so I decided to have a separate two parameters at. Process level so I have specially designed parameters for type and offer type and when the parameters are at the process level makes it not so hard to get and from the C sharp code so we will use getting data from read data into process level parameters and we can do it easily with formal. Formal is simply just an assigning operator where a left part of it will be your parameter that you want to set formal value to this is for example type ID. And right part is formal expression value which will be used now just to get some data out from deep of read realty parameter and offer and type when I click double click here. You see a special macro which displays formal expression and this expression will be interpreted in runtime and replaced by corresponding value in runtime formula is an interpretive tool so it will be started and run according to its settings my process will be starting set type. This is our formula title the same approach another formula drag and drop it here will be used to set offer type ID. So parameter target parameter is offer by ID and formal value takes data from Rosa 7's read data of our type double click. And then we have this macro save it that's how we save this offer type ID here this item we can call it calculate the price or calculate a vg price this is our calculation part. Now it looks like we prepared with the set of no code tools parameters that we use for third round. And now it's time for us to save our process but first of all I want you I want monicant predict confirm that you are good at this stage so if anything should be shown or explained tell me please. If it's not clear what we are doing also please ask. Thanks for the time. Thanks Monika if you have any questions don't don't be shy don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help you understand that listening and doing examples at the same time it's really harder than just listening. So if any questions or some misunderstanding tell me please I will be happy to assist. So our recent steps included taking ID that we expect to get at the beginning of the process reading corresponding ID of reality. I read only two columns type and offer type and I use two formulas to get it out from results of read reality and then that's how we get such parameters and then pass this data at our script task part. So Monika if any assistance needed just tell me that now. Now you see I saved my process and I did not explain what is happening here so when I saved it system oh thank you Monika thank you so system told me that all you changed your C sharp part so requires compilation. And now it saved my metadata and then started to do publishing which physical remains compilation we can check what's going on at our application server side. We can see who exactly consumes most of our system resources now. You can also look at memory consumption and possibly I looked here too late because I already do not see any traces of compilation but CPU highwood. So CPU is quite loaded so possibly we will see oh yeah we see it here we so dot net access at the top of consumption of CPU. You saw dot net Xenno you see so here we have parts of dot net core framework which is used for creation and it's compiling our assembly in so in a dot net library as a result we expect to get set of DOLs. And our package is set to be compiled as a separate assembly let me explain now probably will be not happy now I will not be able to look at it the property of my package so when we designed our package it was automatically set compile as separate assembly. While compilation is going on unfortunately our system will be not response it will not display some data so we will see forever hand in requests and this will happen until our compilation finishes when it successfully finished then we will see and freeze of all pending queries. So now you see our real team package has initial setting compile into separate assembly. This option means that our contents which we did design in our when you have to leave thank you thank you thank you very much for this we will soon we will finish version thank you. Okay so our package is compiled separate assembly so it means special mode when package compile will part is saved separately and compiled separately into a library that will be saved somewhere on disk nearby to our package stuff so here we have you as our real team here we have auto generated code. This code was generated by creation according to the process structure you see class definition class name is designed as name of our process plus process methods proper suffix. So we have class name as combined stock from process name and some suffix then we have method inside of it and you can see our this method is a constructor okay not so interesting this method is implementation of our script task as we did not name our script task into something useful then this script task has name script task one let me show you. Our process. This script task has parameters and this is just name script task one that's why inside of our code we saw script task one execute the text for it is exactly the same as we typed and saved. And finally this class will be used into compilation to get final result of compilation which is saved into files been and this is our deal which includes results of our logic for me. Here we may find some code but until we are not using any very reverse engineering tools we probably will not be very successful with analyzing this code but you may just trust me that finally this code includes business logic and our class stuff here. So finally we compiled our solution it turned out into a DLL saved on this because this DLL is used as part of our application website we have approximately 200 of similar DLLs and if our package for example was not compiled separately so if you disable this option for a package then it will turn to much longer. So we have a lot of base product packages they have no such option compiled separately so they all compile into one big DLL which is saved here in the rest of configuration or to generate folder so we have a set of C sharp files and been folder here turns into this DLL. So we have a lot of code which is quite a lot and this is result of compilation of big number of base product packages that finally form this DLL so recompilation of such DLL takes from much longer probably 304 times longer than compiling a separate assembly. The lettering is asking what the difference of setting parameter value for formula and by directly selecting the leader parameters section by process elements. And generally you are asking about this we have a parameter we have value for it so we could we could provide value into this parameter and saving it directly from read data. Yes I understand this idea but I do not like this because it will be not clear for me at what moment of time this parameter will initialize its value and at what moment of time this parameter will change its value. So possibly we can do this you can try and each time when your read data changes or gets new results your parameters should have a corresponding mapped values from read data but I prefer to make it clear and obvious according to the moments when we have some changes so this is read data as we finished with this item it will have a value of the data. We have its own parameters and some results of selection will be saved somewhere here. Then we have formulas to get data from this and put it into parameters here and it looks like quite exact moment when we change parameter values with this formula. If we use parameters directly mapped to read reality it will be not clear for me when exactly parameter will be changed and so I think that our example will lack obviousness and lack visibility of what is going on. Is it more secure to use formula? I think it is the same so it should work when you map the parameter directly but mapping parameter directly so something that we can do like this we can map each to process element like type like this mapping it directly makes it harder to analyze. So personally I do not like this but I think it supported on the platform so you can do this. Thank you Adrien for your very interesting question and let's move on. So now our simple example is ready. I have a quick question about the deal. Is it possible when we are creating this way that we can call other deals maybe outside of this package? Sure it is possible let me show you we have also process level methods. This is kind of a method that is inside of script task but we have also process level methods which can be used globally on the process level. For example if you make a big logic and you finally realize that you do the same steps from different parts of your process maybe you can implement it once in methods area and then call it many times with different script tasks in the process. So it makes it more organized and better constructed so you make it easier to support in future. Also we have usings and you can include additional DLLs and namespaces here so you can include necessary DLLs, DLLs, and namespaces from other parts of your system. And that is how new namespaces will be available and this will be normally compiled and executed. So it is quite common thing how you can add other libraries and namespaces using. And these using will form into let me show you the KG, no, there is a configuration, then your package, then your source, the medical generated source. Here you can see on this standard set of using if you add your own to be added into this list. So that's how sometimes developers really need to use for example Newton soft JSON library to make it simple with a serializing or disseralizing values and maybe other libraries so you can add it here by providing using in process methods. Okay, so we successfully saved and published our process and you saw it was no problem with compilation but in real life when you do development of your own solution of course you will get compilation issues, they will get error messages. So you will have to go to your code find corresponding lines fix it, say again, publish again and finally you'll have to make your process work normally. Please note, if your system is saved in a state that means you have compilation errors, you will not be able to apply any changes in comparable area until you fully fix your issue with compilation. So it's better and it's like strong advice for you it's better to keep your system always in fully compatible mode. I mean making your solution if you try to compile it always compiles successfully because if you keep your solution with compilation errors, you will never know. That something is working good or not and you will not be able to easily apply changes in your compilation, compatible stuff because each time you try to compile you will get the same errors. So to recommend to keep your system to be saved in a like health seeds state when any compilation finishes successfully. So we can we already have some part of our process which finally performs some calculation. We can register our process at our section. I will show you how we can do this. So we can run a process as an action in our list or we can run a process by action or a button in edit page from edit page. It looks a bit easier. Let's start from this opening our freedom UI edit page then go to its editor. We will finish soon. Today sessions of don't worry I understand we are going a bit behind the schedule and so today we will start maybe 10 or 15 minutes more. So this is our page design. My plan is to run my process by a button, but I predict that I will have a bit more different action. So possibly I can use a button with sub menu. Let me show you how we can do this. For example, we can put a button somewhere here, modify its size, style, and title. Like actions and we can also provide some kind of typical icon used for actions. Something like this. This is very typical for creation. No, it's own action, but we will have menu items. Let's make a subordinate menu items like calculate. Everage price. This will be our action title action value will be run business process. This one run process which process to run. We have different modes to start our process. Regardless of the page means with no parameters. For selected page means for edit page data and it means we can only pass record ID as argument. This is good for us. Also we have new mode which appear recently to select the records in list. It will get list argument. It's not for our case here, but this is feature which appeared just recently in 812. So just very recently. Okay, select page and we have process where the record ID is passed. We have only three suitable parameters. Thanks developers for filtering this in previous versions. This drop down showed all the columns. I mean all the parameters and generally it's not good because all parameters included into jurors and put it decimals are not suitable for greed. And we only now see some filter stuff. So real data will be recipient of our ID of currently edited record. And as you can see, this is a no code setting. So it doesn't require any special coding for us. So we can do it with no code tools by passing this data. Okay, great. We can also use this icon for this start. We can do some calculation. I can that will demonstrate make it a bit more attractive menu item. We can rename it. So menu item. Coke. Now it is price just to make it easy to find if we ever needed to find an hour view config diff. So as you can see, this action is quite easy to do. Let's go back to action sleeves and we can check how it works. So action will be always available. We can just save this page. Also in recent version, we had an unique option to run processes by for list for selected records in a list. Let's do this. Let's go back to list page. We can also make customization here. Now we can make an action that will be started for list. We have a special settings here. Filter element bulk actions such bulk actions is called by so we can call it. We can find it here when we start to select data. So let's make one more bulk action like code, create. We will reach price. Our action will be again run process. Where? Oh, it's my fault. I do it incorrectly. So if it is not not this way. Okay, let's go back. So it was not correct approach. I need to make a button instead. Okay, let's make a button. Let's put it somewhere here. Size. Action run process which process to run. Okay, we have a utility price for selected records in list. And we have the only suitable list here data table this one. Okay, no supporting items. So it will be just an example for you. How you can run process in list this feature supports it supported only starting from version 812. So quite recently only for recent months. I think if you have a bit older version, you will not be able to implement this easily. Okay, save it. Let's just start to test it. So we can close the editor. We can also close this one. Maybe it's remote just to fight with any possible occasion of browser cash. So let's calculate something for houses for sale. For example, for this record, calculate average price. Something was started with name and defined not found. Something is not good here. Okay, we can also check process log. Did you have any start of the process today. No means that we faced something wrong. It did not start. Okay, and let's go to realty edit page. Okay, apartments for sale, opening it. So as an argument, we have this ID actions, calculate the rich price successfully started. Now we have no visual outage. So we only know that process started. We can go to process vlog. We can see that process successfully completed. We can open history execution of the site and sort by date of start read, set formulas, calculation, finish. It looks like everything went correctly here. We do not know exact values, exact numbers. We will study debugging of it tomorrow. Now we just make sure that the process starts and normally finish. Okay, now let's fix our stuff with the list. Looks like I missed something very simple. So let's go to customize list again. Here is our button that runs process, this process, how to run the process. Oh, yeah, I just missed very important parameter where the record is fast. Realty I did parameter. So it was my fault. I overlooked it. Okay, save it save this stuff and then we see how goes pay close. Probably to work. No, we have to reload it. How is this for sale? No, no, no, we wanted to run it in list. Okay, so this one is how a list selected data, calculate average price successfully started. I expect to run only one instance of the process here. Yes, it was correctly started seconds ago. We can see all the steps were done. We can also see execution diagram, which will show us these steps executed. And tomorrow when one car returns and you will be not so tired. So we will move on with we will move on with debugging is code and also making it visible visual. So today we made only part of the work. Today we implement the main calculation part of the process. We got some result data, but we do not know how to actually see it. So tomorrow I will show you today we only focused on C as part. In order to make this example fully working, we need some more items and we need debugging to make sure that our code works accordingly our expectations. I just wanted you to see how we can run this calculation for multiple scenarios, for example houses for sale, houses for rental and apartments for sale. We have three selected records. We can run this process. And I expect to run three instances of processes. Let's check out. Yes. Now you see the last minute we have three instances of processes started and each one with its own input arguments. So many how many records you run the same number of records you will see here in calculate average price process log record process log shows you history of all started processes in your system. And for each process started you see its elements you see start and date is status. We will see how you can how we can debug this especially C sharp part and also how to check its performance. So today's session is over. The most interesting part will be tomorrow when we will run this process and display some data and also how will debug this process. Thank you very much for your today attention in any case in case of any questions please ask. And to see each other tomorrow. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I have a quick question if that's okay. Yes, it's just about business processes. So at the moment we're trying them to we're binding them to buttons. But like what can we bind them to like how robust is this can we find them to like objects or can we bind them to whenever a data is changed on a certain object or something like that. It's possible sure but I tried to keep it simple and use all of those possible of no code. That's perfect. I understand. I'm just curious. It's it may not but yes later I will show you how we can trigger some business logic that will start according to data change. And for example, insert of new reality and then we can run some business process that will start only in certain conditions. And for example, only if house or apartment for reality was added. I will show it right. It's not so difficult. So we are looking only at small part of available tools that we have on board on business process platform. So I'm trying to show it simply but in general, it could be much more complicated and also processes and the more complicated. We have a sub process item which makes it possible to develop big processes that contain smaller processes inside. So you can do it in much more complicated way and trying to keep it simple because we are studying studying we need to see some simple examples understand how it works. Understand how you can control it and then go further with more complicated complicated scenarios and topics. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Thank you. See you soon. See you tomorrow. As usual, you will receive your recording very soon. Thank you. Goodbye.",
