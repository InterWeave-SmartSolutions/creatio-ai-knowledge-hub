Create hints and instructions in the knowledge base articles for a dynamic case
stage on the **Opportunities** form page or any other form page that is
connected to a dynamic case and has the **Playbook** component. The instructions
in playbooks will help employees to complete their tasks and reduce the time it
takes them to search for the needed information. You can use any knowledge base
article as a hint on as many stages of as many cases as necessary.

Example

Add best presentation practices from the knowledge base to the "Presentation"
step of the opportunity case. Users will be able to view the recommendations
when they reach this step.
