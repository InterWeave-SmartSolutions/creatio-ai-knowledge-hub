To do this: Open the Creatio root directory path \\Web.config file using any text editor, e.g., Notepad. Go to the <appSettings> part. Add the following line: < add key = \"aspnet:UseLegacyRequestUrlGeneration\" value = \"true\" / > Save the changes . Make the same adjustments to the Creatio root directory path \\Terrasoft.WebApp\\Web.config configuration file. Restart the website in IIS and clear the Redis server cache.

How does the app open Creatio links? ​ Creatio links have the following format: https://mysite.creatio.com/Navigation/Navigation.aspx?schemaName=Contact&recordId=bc260218-b43b-493a-9da6-1f2f8e8e28f2 where: mysite is the website name. Contact is the schema name. bc260218-b43b-493a-9da6-1f2f8e8e28f2 is the ID of the schema record. Mobile Creatio deals with links as follows: If the website name is the same as the website into which you are logged in the app, the link is opened in the app. If the website name is different, the link is opened in the default browser. If the schema name is invalid, the app opens the link and sends you to the start page. If the record ID is invalid, the app opens the link and displays a message that a record does not exist.
