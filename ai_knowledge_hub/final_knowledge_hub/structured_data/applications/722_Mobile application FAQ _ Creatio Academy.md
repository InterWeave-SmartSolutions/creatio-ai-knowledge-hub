## Why will the mobile app not sync in online mode (Error "Item% 24 batch not found)?​

Online sync errors are often associated with the on-site deployment of Creatio.
Certain combinations of the IIS, .NET Framework, and ASP.NET services screen
special characters ($ character) in website URLs. The mobile app cannot connect
to the Creatio website because of that.

To omit the “$” character while generating request URLs, introduce a different
type of query generation by setting up configuration files on the Creatio
server. To do this:

1. **Open** the **Creatio root directory path** \Web.config file using any text
   editor, e.g., Notepad.

2. **Go to** the `<appSettings>` part.

3. **Add** the following line:

   <add key="aspnet:UseLegacyRequestUrlGeneration" value="true" />  


4. **Save the changes**.

5. **Make the same adjustments** to the **Creatio root directory path**
   \Terrasoft.WebApp\Web.config configuration file.

6. **Restart the website** in IIS and clear the Redis server cache.

## How to resolve the synchronization conflict in the offline mode?​

If the conflict occurrs because of access permissions during the synchronization
with the desktop application, you can resolve it by canceling the modifications
you made in the mobile application.

Example

The administrator restricted the permissions to edit the account type for all
employees. The mobile user changes the account type in the offline mode. During
the synchronization process, the user gets a notification about conflict.

note

[Access management](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/setup-and-administration/category/access-management).

To resolve the conflict:

1. **Tap** the **Review issues** button.

2. **Select** a record that invoked a conflict of permissions in the
   synchronization log.

3. **Tap** the **Revert changes** button (Fig. 1).

As a result, all changes made in the account record will be reverted and the
record will be removed from the synchronization log. The local record will be
updated with the latest data from the desktop application.

You can send a request for access permission to an administrator. Learn more
about actions with records in a separate article:

## How can I clear the mobile app cache?​

You can clear the mobile app cache in one of the following options:

- Log out of the application. In this case, the app cache will be cleaned
  automatically.

- Clean the cache of the mobile device.

Important

After cleaning the mobile application cache, all data modifications that were
made offline and not synchronized with the main application will be deleted.

## How can I set up push notifications for mobile application users?​

Mobile application users will receive push notifications and reminders that
contain valuable updates, such as meeting reminders or feed notifications.
Customize them using the Business Process Designer. Learn more:

guide.

## How does the app open Creatio links?​

Creatio links have the following format:
`https://mysite.creatio.com/Navigation/Navigation.aspx?schemaName=Contact&recordId=bc260218-b43b-493a-9da6-1f2f8e8e28f2`

where:

- **mysite** is the website name.
- **Contact** is the schema name.
- **bc260218-b43b-493a-9da6-1f2f8e8e28f2** is the ID of the schema record.

Mobile Creatio deals with links as follows:

- If the website name is the same as the website into which you are logged in
  the app, the link is opened in the app. If the website name is different, the
  link is opened in the default browser.
- If the schema name is invalid, the app opens the link and sends you to the
  start page.
- If the record ID is invalid, the app opens the link and displays a message
  that a record does not exist.
