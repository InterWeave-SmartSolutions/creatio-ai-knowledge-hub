This lets you:

- Plan field staff meetings ("visits").
- Build optimal routes between the meeting locations on the map.
- Maintain the visit agenda and guidelines.
- Keep a record of the employee’s activities during the visit.
- Create custom visit agenda and guidelines.

Field staff uses Creatio mobile app in the field to record the meeting time
frame and conduct presentations during a visit. Field Management for Creatio is
fully compatible with all Creatio products. Use it as a framework for custom
field apps. For example, field banking or field service.

2. Click **Installed applications**. The app management page opens.
3. Click **Add application** → **Choose from Marketplace**.
