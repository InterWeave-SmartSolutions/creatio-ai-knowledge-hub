  "content": "Version: 8.3 On this page Visit rules determine the different types of visits and med rep’s \"to-do\" list for each visit type. This enables you to plan med rep visits with a few clicks, as Creatio will populate the properties of each visit automatically, according to applicable visit rule. You can set up rules for physician and pharmacy visits, as well as the list of activities that your employees must follow during visits. For example, the first step of any visit is the \"Check-in\" action, which confirms that the med rep has actually arrived at the visit site. Completing this action will automatically save the information about the employee's location. Other visit activities may include presentation of new products, order placement and \"Check-out\". Open the system designer by clicking in the top right corner of the application window. Click the Lookups link in the System setup block. Click the Field sales rules lookup. On the lookup content page, click the New rule button. Populate the required fields: Populate the rule name, for example, \"Visit to a doctor rule — I quarter\". In the Start and Due fields, specify the time limit of rule validity. Specify visit duration (including travel time) in the corresponding field. The specified duration will be used by the system when creating visit activities. In the Number of visits field, enter the approximate number of visits of this type that a med rep can perform during one day. In the Visit category field, select the \"Visit to the doctor\" or \"Visit to the pharmacy\" value. Save the changes. Similarly, specify the other rules. Normally, different visit rules apply to different periods and locations. As a result, these rules will be taken into account when building a schedule for the med reps. If several rules can be applied to a sales outlet, Creatio will let you choose which rule to use. Manage med rep visit actions ​ A list med rep’s actions during a visit is set up on the Actions during visit detail of the Field sales rules lookup. To add an action: Open the Field sales rules lookup. Select a rule to form an action and click (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Open a rule for editing On the rule page, expand the Actions during visit detail and click . Populate the columns of the new record: Select the visit action type \"Check-in\", \"Check-out\" \"Presentation\" or \"Number of patients.\" To set up sequence of med rep activities, use the Actions priority order field. Select the Required checkbox for the actions that the med rep should not be able to skip. The med rep will not be able to complete the visit until all the required actions are performed. Click to save the visit action. Similarly, add the rest of the visit actions. As a result, when planning visits in the Activities section, the Visit actions will be populated automatically. The list of actions on the detail will correspond to the list of actions set up in the lookup for the corresponding visit rule. The Action types lookup contains a pre-configured list of actions performed during a visit to a doctor or pharmacy These actions are available by default when setting up actions for physician or pharmacy visits on the Actions during visit detail of the Field sales rules rules. You can supplement the list of available action types by adding the needed types to the Action types lookup. Med rep can complete an action by toggling a switch in the mobile device. The connection between visit actions and system sections (e.g., creating a new contract based on a visit action) is carried out only through development. Pre-configured rules for \"Visit to the doctor\" ​ Check-in When the action is performed, the system receives the GPS coordinates of the med rep's location and the visit is assigned the \"In progress\" status. Presentation When the action is performed, a PowerPoint or PDF presentation will open on the mobile device if it has been added to the Attachments and notes detail of the visit. Number of patients A pharmaceutical rep, based on the information from a physician specifies the number of patients that the physician treats regularly and whose diagnoses requires treatment by the promoted product. Based on this value, the doctor is categorized. Promoted products When performing this action during visits, a pharmaceutical rep, based on the information from a physician specifies how many units of promoted products has the physician prescribed since the last visit.. Based on this value, the doctor is categorized. Check-out When the action is performed, the system receives the GPS coordinates of the med rep's location and the visit is assigned the \"Completed\" status. Pre-configured rules for \"Visit to the pharmacy\" ​ Check-in When the action is performed, the system receives the GPS coordinates of the med rep's location and the visit is assigned the \"In progress\" status.

SKU Monitoring Opens the SKU monitoring window for the med rep to enter changes in SKUs and specify whether the products are on display in a pharmacy.

Add a presentation to a visit ​ Set up the Presentation action to enable the pharmaceutical reps show presentation from a mobile device during visits. Create a knowledge base article and add a PowerPoint presentation (*.pptx) or PDF file on its Attachments detail. Then, connect the article to the action.

Set up a list of promoted products ​ When monitoring SKU, a med rep must only see a list of products promoted via a doctor or pharmacy. This is done by setting up individual lists of promoted products for each customer contact or account. There are two ways to do this. To set up the list of products promoted via accounts : Go to the Accounts detail of the product page and add the list of all accounts that promote the product. The information about the product will be automatically added to the Products detail of an account page.

During a visit to a doctor, when performing the Promoted products action, a med rep will see only the products promoted via this contact. note If an account has more than one subsidiary companies, when adding products to the Products tab of the parent company, added products will appear on the corresponding tabs of the subsidiary companies.
