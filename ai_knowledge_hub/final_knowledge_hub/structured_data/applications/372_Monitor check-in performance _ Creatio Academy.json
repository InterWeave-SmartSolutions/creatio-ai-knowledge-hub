Current time is indicated for the coordinates received in real-time while the time of caching is used for the cached coordinates. Check-in verification procedure ​ At check-in Creatio captures the current or cached coordinates of the latest med rep’s location and compares them to the account’s address coordinates in case of a visit to pharmacy or to the contact’s address in case of a visit to physician. The allowable discrepancy between these coordinates is specified in meters in the \"Check-in verification range\" system setting (\"CheckInRadius\" code).

If the GPS coordinates of the med rep and the visited account or contact are in the verification range , the check-in will be verified and the status of the visit will be changed to \"In progress\". The \"Check-in coordinates are within range\" status will be displayed on the Check-in and check-out results detail. In case distance between the med rep GPS coordinates and the factual check-in are out of the check-in verification range , the med rep will receive the following message: \"Check-in coordinates are out of range. Would you like to save check-in results?\" If this result is saved, the check-in will have the \"Check-in coordinates are out of range\" status. If the check-in verification is not possible (the address of an account is not specified or a med rep had no Internet connection during the verification process), the med rep will receive the following message: \"Unable to verify check-in coordinates.

Set up check-in verification ​ Use the following system settings to set up check-in verification: \"Use last known location of user\" (\"UseMobileLastKnownLocation\" code). This system setting enables a mobile device to use the latest cached sales rep’s location and save it as the check-in location if the actual check-in coordinates are unknown.
