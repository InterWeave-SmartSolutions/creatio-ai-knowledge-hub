This app is available in Sales and Service Creatio products. For other products,
the application must be purchased separately from the Marketplace.

Use the **Productivity** composable app to organize your working hours, view and
plan activities of your subordinates, track interconnections between activities
and other Creatio sections, and keep records of completed tasks. Synchronize
your working schedule from Microsoft Outlook or Google Calendar with Creatio so
that you can view your tasks and meetings in a single place.

The app lets you schedule activities that have multiple participants, such as
meetings, trainings, and conferences. These activities appear in the schedule of
all required participants.

The activities support attachments and links to meeting platforms such as
Microsoft Teams or Zoom. Creatio can remind the activity owner or participant
about the activity in the communication panel.

You can view activities as an electronic day planner in the **Calendar** section
for the best daily UX. The section lets you filter records in the calendar by
date or participant quickly. It is possible to view the activities of multiple
users simultaneously so that you can schedule group activities easier.

You can also view activities as a Freedom UI list in the **Tasks** section so
that you can view and edit every single activity record as quickly as possible.
For example, this is particularly useful for managers.
