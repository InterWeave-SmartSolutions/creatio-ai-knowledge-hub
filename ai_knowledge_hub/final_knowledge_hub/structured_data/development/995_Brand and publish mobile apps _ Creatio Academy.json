General procedure to set up the SDKConsole utility: Perform the preliminary setup. Read more >>> Install and set up the SDKConsole utility. Read more >>> Run the SDKConsole utility. Read more >>> 1. Perform the preliminary setup ​ Ensure you can publish the app . For iOS app, you must be enrolled into Apple Developer program. Learn more: Apple Developer Program . For Android app, you must have a Google Play developer account. Learn more: Google Play Console . Enable Firebase Cloud Messaging to send push notifications. Sign in to Firebase website . Click Go to console . Create a project in the console. For iOS app: Create a Firebase project (official vendor documentation). For Android app: Create a Firebase project (official vendor documentation). Register your iOS and/or Android app in the project. For iOS app: Register your app with Firebase (official vendor documentation). For Android app: Register your app with Firebase (official vendor documentation). Download the config files for the app and save them to your local machine. For iOS app: Get config file for your iOS app (official vendor documentation). For Android app: Get config file for your Android app (official vendor documentation). Specify additional settings to receive Firebase push notifications (on-site only). For iOS app: If your Apple devices aren't getting Apple push notifications (official vendor documentation). For Android app: Android Enterprise Network Requirements (official vendor documentation). Retrieve the service account key. To do this, open the Firebase project → click → Project settings → Cloud Messaging tab → Firebase Cloud Messaging API (V1) → Manage Service Accounts . Create a service account if needed. Learn more: Firebase Service Accounts Overview (official vendor documentation). Create a new service account key. To do this, select a service account → Keys tab → Add key → Create new key → JSON → Create → save the generated JSON file to your local machine. Open the uploaded file and copy the content. View an example of the file content below. Example of the file content { \"type\" : \"service_account\" , \"project_id\" : \"your-project-id\" , \"private_key_id\" : \"your-private-key-id\" , \"private_key\" : \"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\nyour-service-account-key\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\n\" , \"client_email\" : \"your-client-email\" , \"client_id\" : \"your-client-Id\" , \"auth_uri\" : \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth\" , \"token_uri\" : \"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token\" , \"auth_provider_x509_cert_url\" : \"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs\" , \"client_x509_cert_url\" : \"https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/test1-806%40your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com\" , \"universe_domain\" : \"googleapis.com\" } Where your-project-id , your-private-key-id , your-service-account-key , your-client-email , your-client-Id are parameter values generated by Firebase Cloud Messaging. Open the System settings section in Creatio. To do this, click in the top right → System setup → System settings . Save the copied content to the \"FirebaseAccountService\" ( FirebaseAccountService code) system setting. Install Java development kit . For iOS app, install Java development kit version 8. Download the file . For Android app, install Java development kit version 17. Download the file . Register your app with App Store Connect (iOS app only).
