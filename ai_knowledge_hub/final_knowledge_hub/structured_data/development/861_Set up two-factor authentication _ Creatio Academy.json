  "content": "Version: 8.3 On this page Use two-factor authentication (2FA) to enhance account security by adding a second factor verification that confirms the user identity on various actions in Creatio, most importantly login. 2FA is available for both external users and company employees. Audit log records all actions related to 2FA. Learn more: View and archive the audit log . Creatio supports the following 2FA options: Integration with external identity providers via SAML 2.0 protocol . If you store users and their passwords outside of Creatio, you can integrate external identity providers via SAML 2.0 protocol to get a wide range of 2FA capabilities. For example, integrations with Azure AD, Okta, OneLogin. 2FA functionality in Creatio . If you store users and passwords in Creatio and use a basic authentication mechanism via login and password, you can use 2FA functionality available natively in Creatio. Integrations work only via OAuth. Forms authorization method is not available. The native 2FA functionality provides the following options: Authenticate via email, SMS, or mobile app (TOTP). Use multiple 2FA options as part of the authentication process. Use 2FA to confirm changing the password on the user profile page. Use 2FA to confirm administrator actions, such as disabling 2FA for administrators or changing administrator login, password, phone, or email. Recover the password using 2FA. Disconnect the authenticator app, for example, when changing or losing a device. Set up 2FA ​ Set up 2FA via email ​ This authentication method sends the verification code to the email specified in the Email field of the system user or to the login email if you use it. Before you set up this method, make sure all users have email specified and you have a mailbox from which to send the emails configured. Learn more: Set up a personal mailbox . 1. Activate the email 2FA method ​ Click to open the System Designer . Go to the System setup block → Lookups . Open the 2FA methods lookup. Click the Email row → select the checkbox in the Enabled column. Select the checkbox in the Primary column if you want email to be the main 2FA method. Click . 2. Specify the mailbox from which to send verification emails ​ Click to open the System Designer . Go to the System setup block → System settings .
