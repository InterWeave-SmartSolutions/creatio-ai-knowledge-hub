Creatio provides robust tools for leveraging UTM parameters in various marketing activities, including email marketing, website tracking, social media integration, and more. This article explores how to best use UTM parameters within the Creatio platform and integrate them with other tracking and lead generation features. UTM parameters are parameters added to URLs that help you track the performance of your campaigns across different platforms. These parameters typically include parameters like utm_source , utm_medium , utm_campaign , utm_term , and utm_content that give detailed insights into how visitors arrive at a website and what actions they take. For example, you are running an email campaign to promote a new product launch. You have a newsletter that includes a call-to-action (CTA) button that directs recipients to the product landing page. You want to track how effective this email is at driving traffic and conversions. You can build the following link using URL building tools, such as Campaign URL Builder by Google Analytics: https://yourwebsite.com/new-product?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=product_launch&utm_term=summer&utm_content=cta_button . View the parameter breakdown in the table below. Parameter Explanation utm_source=newsletter Identifies the source of the traffic. For this example, since the traffic is coming from your email newsletter, you set utm_source=newsletter . utm_medium=email Specifies the medium through which the link was shared. For this example, because this is an email campaign, you use utm_medium=email . utm_campaign=product_launch Names the specific campaign with which the link is associated. For this example, since the purpose of this email is to promote a new product, the campaign name is utm_campaign=product_launch . utm_term=summer Identifies the keyword or search term associated with the campaign. For this example, if the product is part of a summer promotion or you are targeting the keyword \"summer\" in your email content, you use utm_term=summer . This can help to track seasonal interest or keyword performance related to \"summer.\" utm_content=cta_button Differentiates between similar content or links within the same email or campaign. For this example, if your email contains multiple links, such as a text link and a CTA button, you use utm_content=cta_button to track clicks specifically on the button. This helps you determine which element in your email drives the most engagement. UTM parameters are especially crucial when it comes to paid ads. By incorporating UTM parameters into the URLs used in your paid campaigns, you can effectively track the performance and quality of your ads, keywords, and lead forms. This data lets you see which ads are driving the most traffic and conversions. This, in turn, lets you optimize your ad spending and improve ROI. Additionally, UTM parameters are invaluable for A/B testing landing pages. By assigning different UTM parameters to each variation of a page, you can clearly identify which version performs better. This provides critical insights into user behavior and preferences. In Creatio, UTM parameters are particularly valuable for tracking the origin of leads or contacts, measuring the success of email campaigns, integrating data from social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn, etc. Take advantage of UTM tracking in Creatio ​ Track prospect sources and channels using UTM parameters ​ Creatio lets you track lead sources and channels using UTM parameters seamlessly. When a prospect clicks on a link that contains UTM parameters and completes a form on an integrated landing page, Creatio captures the UTM data and attributes it to the corresponding lead or submitted form. This helps to understand which campaigns or platforms are driving the most valuable traffic. The Populating Contact with Submitted Form's Data business process available in the Lead Generation app automates the collection of this data. When a form is submitted, this process populates the Contact record in Creatio using the submitted information. This includes the Source and Channel fields based on the UTM parameters. This automation ensures that you have accurate and up-to-date information on the origins of their leads.
