- Predictive AI helps users make informed decisions by providing recommendations
  based on data analysis. For example, Creatio.ai can suggest the next best
  actions for a sales opportunity based on historical data and engagement
  patterns.
- Generative AI creates content or responses automatically, such as generating
  personalized emails, meeting summaries, or marketing copy tailored to specific
  customer segments.
- Agentic AI autonomously executes tasks on behalf of the user, such as
  scheduling follow-up meetings or updating records in the CRM based on
  predefined triggers and conditions.

## AI Agents​

AI Agents are independent entities that operate within Creatio.ai and help
automate complex user tasks. The task performed by an agent depends on its
complexity, for example, creating email campaigns, and its area of competence,
for example, service or sales support.
