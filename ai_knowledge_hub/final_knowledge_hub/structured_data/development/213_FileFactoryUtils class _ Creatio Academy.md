`Terrasoft.File` namespace.

The `Terrasoft.File.FileFactoryUtils` class provides extension methods for the
`UserConnection` class and factory class that implements the
`Terrasoft.File.AbstractionsIFileFactory` interface. This way, the class
provides access to the factory for creating new or getting existing files.
Therefore, an instance of `UserConnection` or `SystemUserConnection` is required
for file management.
