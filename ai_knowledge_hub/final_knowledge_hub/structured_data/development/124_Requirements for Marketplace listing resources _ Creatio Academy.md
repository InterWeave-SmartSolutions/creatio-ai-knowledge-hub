## Requirements for Pricing and support tab properties​

Requirements for Marketplace listing pricing depend on the payment model.

### Requirements for pricing of paid listings​

- If your Marketplace listing includes multiple pricing options, for example,
  tiers, extended packages, specify a marketing pricing name for each pricing
  option to display on Creatio Marketplace. Do not use the listing name or the
  type of deployment in the pricing names. Example of marketing pricing name:
  `Enterprise edition`, `Professional edition`.
- Specify a fixed price for paid listings. If each pricing option offers
  different opportunities or features to users, add multiple prices.
- Select a licensed model that enables users to subscribe to the Marketplace
  listing for either a single user or unlimited number of users.
- Specify a fixed price for paid listings. You can add multiple versions of the
  Marketplace listing, for example, base, extended, etc. Specify the price for
  each version of the Marketplace listing.
- Explicitly state the requirement to purchase another Marketplace listing or
  multiple license types of the current Marketplace listing.
- Explicitly state whether your Marketplace listing requires additional payments
  of external apps or services beyond Creatio pricing or their price is included
  in the listing price. If your Marketplace listing requires additional payments
  of external apps or services beyond Creatio pricing, specify the link to the
  corresponding price list or contact details to receive the price list.
- If you update the price and/or sale conditions after the vendor / Sales
  Partner / Marketplace partner presented the offer to a customer, the listing
  can be distributed with the conditions and prices of the original offer within
  1 month since the update without agreement of other participants. Learn more:
  [Marketplace partner program](https://marketplace.creatio.com/sites/marketplace/files/2025-04/Marketplace-PP-26FY.pdf).

### Requirements for pricing of free listings​

Select a free promotion model of the Marketplace listing if you are a vendor of
your own solutions and are going to integrate them with Creatio. The purpose of
the free payment model is to attract prospects. Such listings let you increase
brand awareness and the number of customers. Publish the connector on the
Creatio Marketplace to attract new customers and profit from your solution.

### Requirements for changing the pricing model​

You can **change the pricing model** of your Marketplace listing from free to
paid.

Follow these **requirements** to change the pricing model of your Marketplace
listing from free to paid:

- Release a paid Marketplace listing in one of the following **ways** :
  - Release the paid version of the **Marketplace listing as a new listing**. In
    this case, Creatio Marketplace will have a free listing that contains the
    functionality of the previous version and a paid listing that contains
    additional functionality.
  - Release a paid version of the **published Marketplace listing**. In this
    case, Creatio Marketplace will archive the free version and users will no
    longer be able to install it. Only the paid listing version will be
    available on the Creatio Marketplace.

- Enable users who already have the free version of the Marketplace listing to
  continue using it for free.

- Add new custom objects to the licensed object list. If you do not change the
  functionality of the Marketplace listing for the paid version, add a licensed
  operation. In this case, users who have the free listing version will be able
  to use the free version.

- Support the free and paid versions of the Marketplace listing according to the
  current support terms.

### Requirements for Support conditions property​

Provide support in line with the
[Marketplace Technical Support Policy](https://marketplace.creatio.com/sites/marketplace/files/2024-07/Creatio-Marketplace-Support-Policy-Effective-as-of-July-01-2024.pdf)
requirements. The technical support provided for the users depends on the
payment model.

Requirements for technical support of **paid listings** :

- Provide support for the "Basic" and "Business" packages. Support for the
  "Premium" package is optional. Learn more:
  [official Creatio website](https://www.creatio.com/services/support/options).
- Calculate the price for the technical support of the Marketplace listing
  similarly to the price for the technical support of base Creatio products.

Requirements for technical support of **free listings** :

- Provide support via e-mail. Support via other communication channels is
  optional.
- If needed, you can specify the technical support terms.
- We recommend phrasing the support terms as follows: "To keep this listing free
  of charge support is provided only by email."

### Requirements for Link to Terms & Conditions property​

The listing must include the terms and conditions.
