You can add the name, description, text, and expiration date of user consents from any third-party system or service to Creatio manually or by implementing custom business logic. Using user consent storage, system administrators can do the following: View a list of user consents. View user consent history. Track history of a dedicated user consent using the user consent code. Manage a dedicated user consent in custom functionality using the user consent code. For example, you can display a notification about the need to renew a user consent several days before its expiration date. View a list of user consents ​ Open the Lookups section . To do this, click in the top right → System setup → Lookups . Create a lookup . Click New lookup . Fill out the lookup properties. Property Property value Name Consent Object Consent Save the changes. Open the Consent lookup . As a result : The name of a user consent will be displayed in the Name property. The description of a user consent will be displayed in the Description property. The content of a user consent will be displayed in the Consent text property.

The acceptance date of a user consent will be displayed in the Acceptance date property. The user who accepted a user consent will be displayed in the Accepted by property. To renew term of the user consent (the Consent expiration date property value), implement custom business logic that populates the Consent expiration date property using the date specified in the Acceptance date property. For example, the Consent expiration date property value is 6 months later than the Acceptance date property value. Display a notification about the need to renew a term of the user consent a few days before it expires. After renewal, update the values of the Consent expiration date and Acceptance date properties automatically.
