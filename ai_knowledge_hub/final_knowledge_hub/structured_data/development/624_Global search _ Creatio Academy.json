Version: 8.0 On this page Level: beginner The global search integrates ElasticSearch with Creatio. Learn more: Wikipedia . Use the global search to quickly search data in the Creatio by entering a search request in the search string. Creatio always searches in all sections (including custom sections). Global search basics ​ The global search implements recording and transport functions by doing the following: Subscribes clients by creating an index in ElasticSearch and saves the connection between the index and the app. Disconnects clients by removing their index in ElasticSearch. Participates in the indexing process by retrieving data from the database. Creatio executes the following actions using the global search: Search records by their text and lookup fields as well as the Addresses , Communication options , and Banking details expanded lists. Search files and links on the Attachments and notes tab of the record page by their name or description. Take into account common typos and morphology of different word forms in English when handling search requests. The search request is case-insensitive. Rank the search results by relevance both in the actual results list and with any configured filters. For example, if the search is performed from a section, the records of this section are displayed at the beginning of the results list. If a user does not have permissions for a specific object column, such a column is not displayed on the page of global search results.
