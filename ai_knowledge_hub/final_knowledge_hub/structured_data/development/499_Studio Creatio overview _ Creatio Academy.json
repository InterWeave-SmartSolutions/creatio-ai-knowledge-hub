Studio Creatio capabilities ​ Explore Studio Creatio's diverse suite of integrated tools: No-code technology provides a seamless way to create and customize applications, from the modification of business logic on section pages to the establishment of app branding, and more. The No-Code Designer facilitates app customization, while the Freedom UI Designer allows detailed refinement of individual pages and data structures. Additionally, you can configure custom business rules to fine-tune app logic, such as the ability to hide fields based on specific conditions. Composability . Studio Creatio is built on a composable no-code architecture, enabling organizations to streamline application creation. As all components of the architecture are pluggable, replaceable, and reusable, the extensive configuration, customization, and development efforts are replaced by assembling apps from available components. The platform provides an extensive library of composable components that no-code creators can utilize to assemble function blocks, applications, and even full-fledged products without the need for coding. BPMN 2.0-driven Process Designer offers an intuitive drag-and-drop interface to construct and automate business processes and workflows. Utilizing ready-to-use elements, users can create business processes of any complexity, schedule activities, work with UI pages, process data, and call web services. A user-friendly setup UI and built-in validation tools help not only facilitate the design or update of business process charts but also streamline the debugging process, accounting for all execution details and nuances. Within the Creatio Marketplace, you'll find a broad selection of ready-to-use apps tailored for Studio Creatio.
