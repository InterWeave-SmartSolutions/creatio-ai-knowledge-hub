  "content": "This is documentation for Creatio 8.0 . For up-to-date documentation, see the latest version ( 8.3 ). Version: 8.0 On this page Level: beginner The Creatio platform includes an integrated development environment ( Creatio IDE ). Creatio IDE is located in the Configuration section. The Configuration section lets you execute operations with the structural items. Set up permissions to the Configuration section ​ You can set up permissions to the Configuration section on the system operation level. If a user lacks the permission to access the Configuration section, they receive a standard notification about the lack of permissions to execute an operation when trying to load the section. Out of the box, only Creatio administrators have access to key system operations. Creatio lets you configure access permissions to system operations for users or user groups. Learn more: System operation permissions (user documentation). To set up permissions to the Configuration section: Open the Operation permissions section . To do this, click in the top right → Users and administration → Operation permissions . Select the Can manage configuration elements ( CanManageSolution code) system operation . Set up the access to the Configuration section . To do this, click and specify the user/role in the Operation permission detail. As a result : The record will appear on the Operation permission detail. The Access level column of the record will be set to Yes . Users that have the specified role will have access to the Configuration section. Open the Configuration section ​ You can open the Configuration section in Creatio .NET Framework in several ways: Using System Designer .

This operation might take more than 10 minutes. Creatio generates the source code for schemas in the background. Learn more: Execute operations in the background . The major features of background generation are as follows: Background generation does not affect the core user workflows. Starting compilation or a new source code generation is not possible while the running operation is not complete. If you attempt to start these actions, Creatio warns you that the source code generation is still in progress. We do not recommend working on functionality that requires compilation until the source code generation is done. That includes installing applications and extensions, configuring the UI and business logic. As a result , Creatio will display the corresponding notification in the communication panel.

Learn more: [Execute operations in the background](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=15231).\n\nThe **major features** of background generation are as follows:\n\n  * Background generation does not affect the core user workflows.\n  * Starting compilation or a new source code generation is not possible while the running operation is not complete. If you attempt to start these actions, Creatio warns you that the source code generation is still in progress.\n  * We do not recommend working on functionality that requires compilation until the source code generation is done. That includes installing applications and extensions, configuring the UI and business logic.\n\n\n\n**As a result** , Creatio will display the corresponding notification in the communication panel.\n\n## Manage the file system​\n\n**Configuration** section lets you manage the file system using the **File system development mode action group**.

The compilation errors have the following properties:\n\n  * The error type icon (error ![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/SectionConfigurationGeneralInfo/scr_error_icon.png) or warning ![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/SectionConfigurationGeneralInfo/scr_warning_icon.png)).\n  * The name of the relevant file.\n  * The error description.\n  * The error code.\n  * The number of the line with an error.\n\n\n\nSince Creatio version 8.0.10, Creatio also saves history compilation that was run manually or automatically to the `CompilationHistory` **object**. The `CompilationHistory` object includes errors and warnings that occur as part of configuration, OData, or assembly package compilation.\n\nTo view the compilation results:\n\n  1. **Open the Lookups section**. To do this, click ![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/Manage_Apps/btn_system_designer_8_shell.png) in the top right → **System setup** → **Lookups**.\n\n  2. **Create a lookup**.\n\n     1.
