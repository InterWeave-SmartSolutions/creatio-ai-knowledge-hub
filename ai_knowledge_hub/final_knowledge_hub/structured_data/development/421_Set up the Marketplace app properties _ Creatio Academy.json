Instructions: Download an app . As a result , the properties will be added to a published Marketplace app that has a single package. While managing the Marketplace listings, the *.zip archive that contains the Marketplace app must be uploaded to the Creatio Marketplace Console ( Packages and updates tab → Application file property). Learn more: Steps to publish the Marketplace listing using Creatio Marketplace Console . Add properties to a published Marketplace app that has multiple packages ​ If you install a Marketplace app that comprises multiple packages and has no app properties in Creatio, Creatio generates app properties automatically and saves it to an arbitrary package. If Marketplace apps that have different properties use the same base packages, the package installation ends with an error. Important Use the target package that contains properties only in one Marketplace app. To add properties to a published Marketplace app that has multiple packages: Choose a unique package to store the Marketplace app properties . Do not use this package in other Marketplace apps. Prepare the unique package before installing it into Creatio. Install the Clio utility (performed once). Instructions: official vendor documentation (GitHub). Unpack the *.zip archive that contains the Marketplace app packages. Run the Extract package Clio command to unpack the unique package. Instructions: official vendor documentation (GitHub). Download the app property file and add it to the ...\\[Path to package folder]\\Files\\ directory. Add the Marketplace app packages to the Packages file property. You can modify other property values in the Application Hub. Run the Compress package Clio command to compress the changed unique package into a *.gz package archive. Instructions: official vendor documentation (GitHub). Compress the changed unique package and other Marketplace app packages into a *.zip archive. Install the Marketplace app that contains properties into Creatio. Instructions: Install an app from a file (user documentation). Unlock the packages that contain the Marketplace app functionality using the Clio utility. Instructions: official vendor documentation (GitHub). Important If at least one package is locked, an additional package is created automatically when the properties are changed. Unlock the Marketplace app in the Application Hub. To do this, execute the SQL query to the SysInstalledApp database table. Microsoft SQL PostgreSQL Oracle UPDATE SysInstalledApp SET Maintainer = ( SELECT TextValue FROM SysSettings JOIN SysSettingsValue ON SysSettingsValue . SysSettingsId = SysSettings .

Add properties to a new Marketplace app ​ The procedure to add properties to a new Marketplace app depends on the number of packages that contain the app functionality. Add properties to a new Marketplace app that has a single package ​ Instructions: Set up the app properties (user documentation). Add properties to a new Marketplace app that has multiple packages ​ Creatio lets you set a target package and create properties in it before you start developing a new Marketplace app that contains multiple packages. Important Before you add properties to a new Marketplace app that contains multiple packages, make sure that the Marketplace app packages are unlocked and do not contain any Marketplace app properties in Creatio. To add properties to a new Marketplace app that has multiple packages: Choose a unique package to store the Marketplace app properties . Do not use this package in other Marketplace apps. Create a lookup based on the Installed application object. Click New lookup . Fill out the lookup properties. Property Property value Name Installed application Object Installed application Save the changes. Add a lookup value . Open the Installed application lookup. Click New . Fill out the properties of the lookup value. Property Property value Name The app name to display in the Application Hub. Code The app code. Maintainer The Marketplace app developer. The value of the property must match the value of the Publisher ( Maintainer code) system setting. Description Brief information about the Marketplace app. App icon The Marketplace app icon. The property is populated automatically. Icon background color The background of the Marketplace app icon. The property is populated automatically. Save the changes. Create a lookup based on the Package in installed application object. Click New lookup . Fill out the lookup properties. Property Property value Name Package in installed application Object Package in installed application Save the changes. Add a lookup value . Open the Package in installed application lookup. Click New . Fill out the properties of the lookup value. Property Property value Package The Marketplace app package. Installed application The record of installed app from the previous step. Primary Select the checkbox for the unique Marketplace app package and clear the checkbox for other Marketplace app packages. Save the changes. Change the Marketplace app properties . Instructions: Change the app properties (user documentation). Export the package that contains the Marketplace app functionality. Instructions: Download an app .
