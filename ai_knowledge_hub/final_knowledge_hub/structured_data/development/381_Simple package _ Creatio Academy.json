Creatio marks preinstalled packages in the Configuration section using . Creatio includes the following types of preinstalled packages: Base packages . For example, CrtBase , CrtNUI . Third-party packages . These packages are installed from *.zip archives using Creatio IDE or the WorkspaceConsole utility. View base packages in the table below. Package name Description CrtBase, Base Base schemas of the primary objects and Creatio sections, as well as connected objects, pages, process schemas, etc. Platform, CrtPlatform7x Modules and pages of the Section Wizard, List Designer, Dashboard Designer, etc. Managers, CrtManagers7x Client modules of the schema managers. CrtNUI, NUI Functionality connected to the Creatio UI. CrtUIv2, UIv2 CrtDesignerTools, DesignerTools Schemas of Designers and their elements. CrtProcessDesigner, ProcessDesigner Process Designer schemas. User creates various schemas that must be saved to a user-made package. A fresh Creatio installation has no packages open for modification except for the Custom preinstalled package. You can add schemas to this package manually or using the Wizards. Specific features of the Custom package: The Custom package cannot be added to the version control system. As such, you can transfer the package’s schemas to a different environment only using the export and import functionality. Learn more: Transfer packages . Unlike other preinstalled packages, the Custom package cannot be exported to the file system via the WorkspaceConsole utility. The Custom package has all of the other preinstalled packages as dependencies. If you create or install a user-made package, the new package becomes a dependency for the Custom package automatically. Therefore, always place the Custom package the last in the package hierarchy. User-made packages cannot have the Custom package as a dependency. You can use the Custom package in the following cases: You will not transfer changes to a different environment. Not only do the Section Wizard and Detail Wizard create various schemas, they also bind data to the current package. The Custom package does not support the standard package import mechanism. Therefore, if the Custom package is your current package, you can only transfer the bound data to another user-made package via database queries. We strongly recommend against this method as the changes can affect the database structure and render Creatio inoperable. If you have to modify Creatio functionality significantly, use a user-made package. You customize Creatio either manually or using Wizards, and the changes are minor. You do not need to use a version control system. User-made packages ​ Use a user-made package to develop of additional functionality or expand existing functionality. Creatio includes the following types of user-made package: User-made packages created by other Creatio users . User-made packages are locked in the version control system. They cannot be modified. Creatio marks user-made packages in the Configuration section using . User-made packages created by the current user or retrieved from the version control system . They can be modified. Creatio marks user-made packages in the Configuration section using . Before you start development, change the current package . To do this: Open the System settings section . To do this, click in the top right → System setup → System settings . Open the Current package ( CurrentPackageId code) system setting . Change the properties of the system setting. Property Property description Default value A name of user-made package Save the changes . As a result , Creatio will add all configuration elements to the specified user-made package.
