note

This functionality is available for Creatio 8.0.7 and later.

**Toggle panel** layout element lets you add a tab area to the page. Compared to
the similar **Tabs** element, toggle panel has the following special features:

- Toggle panel is controlled by buttons you can place anywhere on the page.
- You can click the active tab button to hide the panel. Click any tab button to
  display the panel again. The panel is hidden by default.

This lets you save more workspace by placing elements that are usually only
needed on demand, such as a **Feed** or **Attachments** component. Learn more:

(user documentation).

Creatio lets you add the **Toggle panel** component in the Freedom UI Designer
and set it up in the source code of the Freedom UI page using low-code tools
only. Learn more:
[ButtonTogglePanel component](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.0&id=15176).

Out of the box, all tabs are closed. If you open a dedicated tab while working
with section records, Creatio saves previously opened tab for all record pages.
