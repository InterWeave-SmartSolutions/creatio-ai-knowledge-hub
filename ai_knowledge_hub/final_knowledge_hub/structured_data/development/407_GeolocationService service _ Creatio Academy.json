Learn more: Work with GPS data in Mobile Creatio . getCurrentCoordinates ( ) Returns the result of bar code scanning. Input parameters GeolocationAccuracy Accuracy to retrieve the coordinates. The time needed to determine the coordinates depends on specified accuracy. Accuracy depends on the following factors: Environmental factors . Buildings, trees, and other obstructions can affect signal strength and accuracy. Device quality . Modern mobile devices generally have more advanced location capabilities than older mobile devices. Used technology . GPS is typically more accurate (5-10 meters) than cellular data (100-1000 meters). Available values lowest On Android: approximately 500 meters.
