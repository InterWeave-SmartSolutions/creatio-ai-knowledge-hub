  "content": "Version: 8.3 On this page Level: beginner Creatio provides a solid compliance backbone by meeting the major privacy standards: SOC 1, SOC 2, and ISO 27001. You can also make Creatio compliant with GDPR and HIPAA. Every Creatio cloud instance runs on an audited, privacy-approved security foundation. This ensures protection by encryption, access controls, and regional hosting. Creatio does not have its own LLM (large language model), does not use public AI services, and does not train the LLM used in Creatio.ai on Customer Data. We work with a separately deployed LLM instance. LLM as software is hosted and operated on Microsoft Azure services in the USA (for the US customers) or Sweden (for EU and other regions) depending on your Creatio website location. Only approved LLMs can be used with Creatio.ai out of the box. Creatio handles the core integrity and reliability of the LLM, maintaining a trusted registry of approved LLMs. Only signed, vetted LLMs get used. We perform extensive testing before deployment, including redteaming to find weaknesses and checking for bias. We also have automatic fallback models ready if something goes wrong, ensuring that the foundation is solid. However, if you need to use your own LLM with Creatio.ai, we also provide this option. The LLM accesses Customer Data limited to the query processing purposes, without any LLM provider's access to it. Customer Data is not stored on external services and is never shared across tenants. Data is encrypted using TLS 1.2+ in transit and AES-256 at rest. When working with files in Creatio.ai, for example, uploading documents for summarization or analysis, all uploaded content is stored in customer-dedicated storage, ensuring that data remains isolated and secure within the tenant's environment. File processing, including extraction, is performed entirely within the Creatio platform infrastructure, with no external systems involved in handling the file content. Furthermore, when the content of a file is used, it is treated with the same strict data privacy policies as any other user-entered input interactions in Creatio.ai. Creatio.ai follows the least-privileged RBAC (role-based access control) cybersecurity principle. Fine‑grained roles restrict both data and model access. Creatio.ai assists with compliance regarding user access permissions and restrictions.​ Read more about the LLM used in Creatio.ai here: Data, privacy, and security for Azure OpenAI Service . Creatio.ai uses Customer Data for communicating with the LLM. This enables it to get clear and useful answers when you ask Creatio.ai something. We call that data context. Context is the information provided to the LLM. It helps the LLM to understand what is expected of it and ensures the accuracy and relevance of its responses. Creatio uses the following types of data as context: Page data . Creatio.ai can request and utilize data from the page where you are currently working. Message history . This is your chat history with Creatio.ai. It helps the LLM to understand the context of previous conversations, enabling it to better interpret your requests and stay within the scope of a single query as long as you need it. Additional context from AI Skills and business processes . If your AI Skill, a sequence of actions designed for achieving a specific goal, has actions configured that use Customer Data as output parameters, Creatio.ai can use this data to generate responses, trigger functions, etc. Creatio.ai does not have access to previous chat history if you have clear it or start a new conversation. We strongly recommend using Creatio.ai only for the issues related to your usage of Creatio services for the internal business purposes, as described in your agreement with Creatio.
