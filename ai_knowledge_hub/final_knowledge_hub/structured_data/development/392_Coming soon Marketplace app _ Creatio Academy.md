A **coming soon Marketplace app** is an app that is being developed and has a
scheduled release date. You can develop one of the planned Marketplace apps or
add a beta release of your app. These apps are displayed on the
[Application map](https://marketplace.creatio.com/catalog?f%5B0%5D=upcoming:1&f%5B1%5D=upcoming:2)
with the **Coming soon** badge.

## Prerequisites to add a coming soon Marketplace app​

You can add your app to the Application map as a coming soon Marketplace app if
you meet the following **prerequisites** :

- Have well-defined use cases for the app.
- Have a developed beta release of the app.
- Have an ETA no longer than 3 months from the current date.
- Have an existing Partner Agreement or Marketplace Partner Agreement.
- Have one or more active paid subscriptions for your other Marketplace apps.

If you meet the prerequisites, you can add the coming soon Marketplace app to
the Application map.

If you want to **develop a planned Marketplace app** from the Application map,
take the following steps:

1. Click the **Ready to build this app?** link of a Marketplace app.
2. Fill out the request fields.
3. Click **Send** to send a request to Creatio Marketplace support.

A **planned Marketplace app** is an innovative app idea that the users need. The
planned Marketplace app does not have a developer and scheduled release date.
Creatio displays planned Marketplace apps on the Application map with the
**Planned** badge.

If the Creatio Marketplace support approves the request, you will be assigned as
the developer, and the planned Marketplace app will become the coming soon
Marketplace app.
