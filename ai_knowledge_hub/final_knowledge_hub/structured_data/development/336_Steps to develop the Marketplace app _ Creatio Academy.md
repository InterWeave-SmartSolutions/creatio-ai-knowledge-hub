**Steps** to develop the Marketplace app are as follows:

1. Prepare the app development environment.
2. Develop the app functionality.

## 1\. Prepare the app development environment​

Use the development environment, a separate website, to develop the Marketplace
app. Learn more about the development environment:
[Environments](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=15201&anchor=title-2124-1).

You can deploy the app development website in the following **ways** :

- On-site: deploy the Marketplace app on the local servers of the customer.
- Cloud: deploy the Marketplace app on the cloud. The cloud development
  environment is a bundle of Creatio base products (Sales Creatio, Marketing
  Creatio, and Service Creatio). This lets you use any base Creatio
  functionality when developing Marketplace apps.

Learn more about the advantages and limitations of the Marketplace app
development website:
[Creatio main application](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=15051&anchor=title-1165-13).

To **prepare a local development environment** , contact Creatio Technical
support (`support@creatio.com`) to retrieve the binary files of the Creatio app.

To **prepare a cloud development environment** :

1. Open the [Creatio Marketplace](https://marketplace.creatio.com/) website.
2. Select **Developer profile** in the account menu of the toolbar.
3. Click **Applications** → **Development site** on the properties panel.
4. Enter the email address to send the link to the development environment in
   the **Order cloud development site** field.
5. Click **Send** to request a cloud development environment to the Creatio
   Technical support.

Creatio Technical support provides a free cloud development environment after
processing the request. The user receives an email with a link to the
development environment app to the email address from the **Order cloud
development site** field. The link to the development environment app is
displayed on the **Development site** tab of the **Applications** section in the
Developer profile.

## 2\. Develop the app functionality​

When developing a Marketplace app, the developer can create any additional
elements of the system, configuration, business processes, mobile app, or
integration with software, service, or external app. The Marketplace app can be
an improvement of any base Creatio product.

A Marketplace app is a set of packages. It lets you extend the functionality of
the base Creatio products. Learn more about packages:
[Packages basics](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=15121).

The number and composition of Marketplace app packages depend on the complexity
of the implemented functionality. For example, to invoke a third-party service
from an existing record page, replace one or more configuration element schemas,
and group them in a single user-made package. To add a Creatio section,
implement multiple dozen configuration element schemas.

The Marketplace app development, as well as the Creatio instance, is performed
using
[development tools](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/dev/development-on-creatio-platform/category/development-tools)
and based on the basic principles of software design, in particular, the **Don’t
repeat yourself (DRY)** principle. Creatio architecture implements this
principle via **package dependencies**. Learn more about the DRY principle on
the
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Don%27t_repeat_yourself&oldid=1120914092).
Learn more about package dependencies:
[Packages basics](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=15121&anchor=title-2105-3).

Learn more about tools for Marketplace app development in separate guides:
[Development tools](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/dev/development-on-creatio-platform/category/development-tools),
[Marketplace app development](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/dev/development-for-creatio-marketplace/category/development).

We recommend publishing the app as a Coming soon Marketplace app on the
Application map if the app is not finished yet, but a beta release is available.
Learn more:
[Coming soon Marketplace app](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=15026).

After that, you can move on to publishing the Marketplace app. Learn more:
