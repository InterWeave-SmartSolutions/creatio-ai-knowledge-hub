**Creatio** is a no-code platform designed to accelerate application
development, implementation, and scaling. The platform is built with
customization, flexibility, and scalability in mind. This makes application
development possible for developers of varying skill levels – from a business
analyst to a full-stack developer. Application development in Creatio allows for
different levels of customization depending on the complexity and type of
business goals.

## Creatio customization levels​

Creatio architecture comprises several logical levels of interaction:

![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/CreatioCustomization/7.18/scr_logic_levlels_en.png)

Note that the Creatio core level is an unmodifiable component. Development in
Creatio is done on the configuration and database levels.

### Database​

**Database** is the physical data storage level. The database stores client
data, application settings, and access permissions.

Creatio tools let users work with data in the UI. As such, you do not need to
work with database objects directly.

For certain tasks, the database level development is the most logical solution
and the fastest method. You can implement custom business logic on the database
level using views and stored procedures. Afterwards, you can call the business
logic from custom configuration elements.

### Core​

The **core** is an unmodifiable part of Creatio. It is a set of libraries
implementing the base Creatio functionality.

The **back-end libraries** are written in C# with the .NET Framework platform
classes. Developers can create back-end class instances and use the the back-end
libraries, but they cannot make any changes to these classes and libraries.

The main **back-end core components** :

- [ORM data model](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15246) and
  its operation methods. In most cases, we recommend using the object model,
  though the back-end core components also allow for direct access to the
  database.
- [Packages](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15121) and
  replacement mechanism.
- Creatio
  [web services](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15262).
- The main designer and Creatio section
  [functionality](https:///academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/no-code-customization/category/ui-and-business-logic-customization).
- Third-party service
  [integration libraries](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15085).
- [Business process service](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15441)
  (`ProcessEngineService.svc`). This Creatio element executes algorithms
  depicted as flowcharts.

The **front-end core classes** are written in JavaScript on top of different
frameworks. Developers can use these classes to create UI and implement other
browser-side business goals. The main **purpose** of the front-end core
components is to manage the operation of client modules.

The main **front-end core components** :

- [External libraries](https://academy.creatio.com/api/netcoreapi/8.0.0/api/index.html)
  of client frameworks.
- [Sandbox](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/dev/development-on-creatio-platform/category/sandbox)
  – a special client core component that manages the message exchange between
  client modules.
- [Base modules](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/dev/development-on-creatio-platform/category/modules)
  – JavaScript files that implement the functionality of the primary Creatio
  objects.

### Configuration​

The **configuration** is functionality available for Creatio users of a specific
workspace, namely:

- Server logic.
- Classes generated by Creatio settings automatically.
- Client logic (pages, buttons, actions, reports, business processes, and other
  configuration elements).

The configuration is an easily modifiable part of Creatio. A specific
configuration constitutes the following element types:

- **Objects** – data-storing entities that combine a table in the database and a
  class on the server’s end.
- **Business processes** – configurable elements that depict a user action
  flowchart.
- **Client modules**.
- **Server modules**.

## Application development tools​

Creatio provides a wide variety of tools to create new and modify existing
applications.

### Open source technologies​

Support of standard programming languages and frameworks streamlines the
development and troubleshooting, as well as makes it easier to find qualified
specialists with the necessary technology stack.

Creatio supports the following **technologies** :

![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/sdk/en/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots.en/CreatioCustomization/scr_thirdparty_logos.png)

The **built-in IDE** lets you implement complex business logic, integrations,
and customizations, accelerating many common configuration procedures. Use C#
and JavaScript to solve the following **problems** :

- Expanding and modifying Creatio functions.
- Organizing the interaction with version control systems.
- Migrating changes between the development, testing, and production
  environments.

Creatio supports **third-party IDEs** (e.g., Microsoft Visual Studio, MS Code,
Rider) that let developers work with projects in a local
[file system](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15111&anchor=title-2098-3).
The familiarity of the IDE, as well as the variety of plug-ins, extensions, and
version control system integrations, etc., streamline the development.
Developers can save time spent on learning new tools and concentrate on coding.

### No-code development​

The no-code development **tools** are a set of drag-and-drop UI editors. They
let you solve the following **problems** :

- Business process and dynamic case automation.
- Data structure modeling.
- UI modeling for web and mobile apps.
- Dashboard creation and report building.
- Integration setup.
- Predictive model building, etc.

The no-code tools cover most use cases. Minimal coding, as well as easily
accessible built-in tools, let business experts, power users, analysts, and
[citizen developers](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/citizen-developer).

[No-code](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15082) article.

### Package mechanism​

Regardless of the tools used to customize the platform, Creatio bundles all
changes into one or more
[packages](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15121) – key Creatio
architecture components. The package architecture lets you create separate
modules from autonomous code blocks, as well as control the package hierarchy
and versioning. That way you can expand the configuration, as well as migrate
changes between the development, testing, and production environments, faster.
The [Marketplace](https://marketplace.creatio.com/) solutions are based on the
same mechanism.

**Any Creatio product** is a set of packages installed on top of the Creatio
core. A package contains object schemas, the source code, business processes,
reports, etc. It also may contain third-party assemblies, SQL scripts, system
settings, and custom data.

![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/en/files/documentation/sdk/en/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots.en/CreatioCustomization/scr_packages_approach.png)

Creatio extension model is based on the **open-closed principle** , where major
application logic is closed for direct manipulations but open for extensions
with user-made packages. A package from another publisher (an integrator
partner, a Marketplace developer, or a customer) can expand any package. This
allows the platform to combine out-of-the box products, marketplace solutions,
and client customizations effectively in almost any variation.

The **package architecture** is the main way to deliver and deploy custom
applications, extensions, and templates, seamlessly integrated with Creatio
Marketplace. Creatio Marketplace is an ecosystem for developing, distributing,
and acquiring customizations – from custom apps and templates to updates and
changes to industry applications.

Packages do not affect the core platform logic, allowing for smooth delivery of
updates to Creatio Core, as well as parallel deployment and updates to generic
functions.

### DBMS–independent architecture and Creatio’s ORM​

Creatio is a **DBMS-independent platform** based on its own
[ORM](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15246). This allows the
developers to build and deliver custom apps to various Oracle, PostgreSQL, or MS
SQL Server configurations easily without any changes to the codebase.

### Process-based business logic​

This is an environment where full-stack developers and business analysts
interact. Users can create their own business logic by simply designing the
needed processes in a drag-and-drop business process editor. Learn more about
working with business processes in the
[BPM tools](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/no-code-customization/category/bpm-tools)
article block.

### Integrations​

Creatio provides all necessary tools for third-party system and app
[integration](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15111&anchor=title-2098-3),
including the support of the REST API, OData protocol, SOAP services, OAuth and
LDAP authentication. You can develop integrations as parts of either Creatio or
a third-party app. Complex tools ensure data security both during the
integration for identification and access control, and during the user structure
management.
