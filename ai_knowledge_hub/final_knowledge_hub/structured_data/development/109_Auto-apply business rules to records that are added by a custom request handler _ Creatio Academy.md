record to a collection. For example, use the functionality if you need to
populate a collection of records, apply business rules for each record and
output the result in a section list.

Creatio lets you execute business rules whenever custom request handler adds a
record to a collection. For example, use the functionality if you need to
populate a collection of records, apply business rules for each record and
output the result in a section list.

To auto-apply business rules to collection records that a custom request handler
adds:

1. **Go to the** `handlers` **schema section**.
2. **Implement a custom request handler** if needed.
3. **Add a** `createItem()` **method** that creates a new record, for example,
   when you click the **Add** button.
4. **Set the** `businessRulesActive` **property to** `true`. The property
   auto-applies business rules to a new collection record.

View the example that implements a custom `usr.AddRecordRequest` request handler
of the Freedom UI page schema below. The handler is bound to the `clicked`
button event and adds the "John Smith" record to the section list. If the
`businessRulesActive` property is set to `true`, Creatio automatically applies
business rules to a new collection record. Otherwise, Creatio does not apply
business rules to a new collection record until the record is selected in the
section list.
