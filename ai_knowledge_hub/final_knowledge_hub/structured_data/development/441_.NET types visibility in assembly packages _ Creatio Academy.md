note

This functionality is available for Creatio 8.1 and later.

As part of the app functionality development, you might need to use source code
(_.cs) and/or executable code (_.dll) of another package in a user-made package.
To ensure that functionality of assembly packages works as expected, consider
**type visibility** when you use code from another packages. To make source code
of an assembly package visible for other package, set the `IsPublic` property
listed in the `descriptor.json` file to `true`.

note

Since Creatio adds assembly package to the project during the compilation, some
functions are applied only after compilation.

Creatio lets you organize the app structure in multiple ways. Consider the app
structure when you use source code from one package in another package.

Package can include the following file content:

- **External assembly packages**. Creatio stores external assembly packages in
  the `Assemblies` directory.
- **Assembly packages**. Learn more:
  [Assembly package](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15125).
  Creatio stores assembly packages in the `Files` directory.
- **Project packages**. Learn more:
  [Project package](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15124).
  Creatio stores project packages in the `Files` directory.
- **Source code type schemas**. Learn more:
  [Configuration elements of the Source code type](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=15108).
  Creatio stores Source code type schemas in the `Schemas` directory.

## Type visibility inside a single package​

For example, package has the structure shown in the figure below.

![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/TypeVisibility/8.1/scr_TypeVisibilitySinglePackage.png)

After compiling the package, Creatio compiles the project source code (`Files`
directory) and schema source code (`Schemas` directory) into the
`<YourPackageName>.dll` library (`Files\bin` directory).

`*.csproj` project of the package automatically references all external
libraries imported into the package. Instructions:
[Assembly package structure and dependencies](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=15125&ver=8.1&anchor=title-3554-1).
After that, the types from the external library are visible to the assembly
package.

In this case, type visibility is as follows:

- The types of the assembly package project (`Class_2.cs`) and types of the
  source code schema (`SourceCodeSchema.cs`) are both visible to each other.
- Types of an external library are visible if you connect the assembly package
  to the `*.csproj` project of the package.

Important

Import external libraries using the **Configuration** section. Do not add
external libraries to the `Files` directory directly or connect them to the
`*.csproj` project of the package manually. This causes assembly packages to
load into the app domain incorrectly and might cause compatibility issues.

## Type visibility between multiple packages​

For example, packages have the structure shown in the figure below.

![](https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documentation/sdk/ru/BPMonlineWebSDK/Screenshots/TypeVisibility/8.1/scr_TypeVisibilityMultiplePackages.png)

In this case, type visibility is as follows:

- When packages are inherited, the project of an assembly package automatically
  receives a link to the parent resources after compilation. This connection is
  only possible within one level of package hierarchy.
- External assembly libraries are visible to inheritors if the `IsPublic`
  property listed in the `descriptor.json` file is set to `true`.
