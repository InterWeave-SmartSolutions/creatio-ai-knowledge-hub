The bulk email service is designed for integrating Creatio with bulk email
providers. Bulk emails are one of the most effective marketing tools for
promoting products and services.

## Bulk email service basics​

In Creatio, emails are managed in the **Email** section, which you can use to:

- Set up email templates.
- Segment email recipients.
- Access delivery analytics.
- Access individual bulk-email feedback.

The following marketing email functions are available in Creatio:

- [**Bulk emails**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=1501). Sent
  once to a set number of recipients. Bulk emails enable you to actively engage
  your customers.
- [**Trigger emails**](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=1506).
  Trigger emails are sent automatically to each recipient who triggers them
  (e.g., submits a web form, clicks a link, etc.).

Access to the marketing email functionality is
[licensed](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=1264) separately.

Set up your email service integration with Creatio for using the bulk email
service. All cloud email service settings for bulk emails are consolidated on
the bulk email setup page in the **Email** section. Learn more about working
with the **Email** section in the
[section](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/creatio-apps/category/email-marketing).

[Email domain verification](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/8.x/setup-and-administration/8.0/category/email-domain-verification)
is required before using the email functionality. The email service available
for sending mass emails from Creatio is
[Elastic Email](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=1714).

[Set up the bulk email contents](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=1974&anchor=title-1572-2)
that the recipients will see (the email template) before sending bulk emails.
There are two types of marketing email templates in Creatio: templates that
display the same content for all recipients (static content), and templates,
whose content differs for different target audiences (dynamic content). Email
templates are created via a no-code visual drag&drop editor called "**Content
Designer**."

You can use
[email analysis](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?ver=8.1&id=1741) to see
the email results and evaluate their effectiveness. The **Email** section
analytics provides detailed statistics both for individual marketing emails and
for aggregated metrics.
