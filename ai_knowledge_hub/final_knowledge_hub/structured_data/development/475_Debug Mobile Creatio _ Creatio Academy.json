Debug Mobile Creatio in Freedom UI ​ Mobile Creatio lets you customize Freedom UI pages by adding components and implement the business logic of the Freedom UI page using request handlers. You can implement a custom request handler in Mobile Creatio using remote module and debug the implemented business logic if needed. To debug Mobile Creatio in Freedom UI: Perform preliminary setup if needed. Receive an app-debug.apk file of the Mobile Creatio app to debug. To do this, contact Creatio support ( support@creatio.com ). Install Google Chrome on your PC. Install and set up Android Studio. Learn more: Android Studio (official Android Studio website), Set up the mobile app emulator . Install and set up Android command-line tool. Learn more: Command-line tools (official Android Studio documentation). Configure the behavior of Android Studio and the Android command-line tools. To do this, set the following environment variables. Variable name Variable description Variable value PATH The path to the adb.exe installation file. C:\\Users\\SomeUserName\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk\\platform-tools , where SomeUserName is the username of your Windows user account. Learn more: Environment variables (official Android Studio documentation). Ensure the business logic of the remote module is implemented in the TypeScript project created via the *.zip archive. Otherwise, copy your customizations to a new TypeScript project created via a *.zip archive. Specify the class that implements the DoBootstrap interface. Open the project in Microsoft Visual Studio Code. Open the creatio-mobile-config.json file. Set the class name to the moduleName property. Save the file. creatio-mobile-config.json file { \"moduleName\" : \"SdkRemoteModuleInMobileApp\" , ... } Run Mobile Creatio to debug using Android Studio in one of the following ways: Android mobile device that has debug mode enabled. Enabling debug mode depends on the model of your mobile device. Mobile app emulator. Instructions: Set up the mobile app emulator . We recommend simultaneously running only a single emulator or mobile device using Android Studio. Upload your customization to the Mobile Creatio to debug. Repeat the step once you create a new emulator or delete data, even if you do not modify the code. Open the project in Microsoft Visual Studio Code. Open the package.json file. Click → build:inject-on-device command. This builds the project and automatically replaces the remote module's code with the remote module's code implemented in the project on the Mobile Creatio launched using Android Studio. Out of the box, the command replaces the code of the main.js and main.release.js files, but you can modify the list of replaced files : Open the project in Microsoft Visual Studio Code. Open the tools directory → common.js file. Specify the list of replaced files using the updateExcludedModules() method. Apply the changes . To do this, restart the Mobile Creatio using Android Studio. Open Google Chrome on the PC. Open the Inspect with Chrome Developer Tools tab . To do this, enter the chrome://inspect/#devices URL in the browser address bar. This opens the Devices tab that includes the list of connected devices. The link to Mobile Creatio is com.creatio.mobileapp . If the browser displays several devices that have the com.creatio.mobileapp link, select the first device. Click the inspect link under the link to Mobile Creatio. This opens the Sources tab of an app debugging window. Find remote module to debug. Most of the classes are in the dev_module directory. Debug Mobile Creatio . Repeat steps 4-10 to apply the changes. Debug Mobile Creatio in Classic UI ​ Run Mobile Creatio to debug using one of the following ways: Mobile device Receive an app-debug.apk file of the Mobile Creatio app to debug. To do this, contact Creatio support ( support@creatio.com ). Install the Mobile Creatio on your mobile device. Run the app on the mobile device. Connect the mobile device to your PC via USB.

To do this: Download Android Debug Bridge (adb). Download . Open the command line. Go to the directory that contains the adb.exe file. To do this, run the command below. cd [Path to the directory that contains the adb.exe file] Open the list of connected devices. To do this, run the command below. adb.exe devices If you see unauthorized status for the mobile device, authorize the device. Disconnect the USB cable.
