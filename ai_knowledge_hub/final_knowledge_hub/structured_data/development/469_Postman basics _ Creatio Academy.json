Working with requests in Postman consists of the following general stages: Adding a request Setting up the request Executing the request Saving the request A collection of requests lets you execute several requests consecutively. Any collection of requests to Creatio must include a POST request to AuthService.svc and a user request for working with data. Using collections facilitates faster testing of large sets of requests. Working with collections of requests in Postman consists of the following general stages: Adding a collection of requests Adding requests to the collection Setting up variables for the request collection Executing the collection of requests We recommend using Postman for testing queries when developing integrations with Creatio via OData 3 or OData 4 .
