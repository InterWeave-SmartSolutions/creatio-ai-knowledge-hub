T-SQL (PL-SQL) experience. Knowledge of WCF, OData, and the RequireJS library.

## Creatio development guidelines​

Creatio developers and partners compiled a set of guidelines as a result of
their experience with the development of new features. Several employees can
develop simultaneously in their personal development environments.

Main **development guidelines** :

- Only develop using a development environment and the `Default` configuration.
- Only develop using a user-made package with all dependencies and data bindings
  installed.
- Use a prefix for custom schemas (`Usr` by default).
- Use a version control system when planning code revisions or co-development.
