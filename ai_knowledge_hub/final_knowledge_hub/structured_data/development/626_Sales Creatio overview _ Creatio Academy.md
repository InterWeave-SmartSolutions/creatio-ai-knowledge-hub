  the likelihood of a sale. It considers customer data, customer service
  history, past similar deals, and other historical data for its evaluation.
- The **recommendation prediction** model creates a list of suggested products
  for an account or contact by analyzing their preferences and considering data
  on completed purchases made by similar customers.

  prediction or numeric prediction, if needed.
