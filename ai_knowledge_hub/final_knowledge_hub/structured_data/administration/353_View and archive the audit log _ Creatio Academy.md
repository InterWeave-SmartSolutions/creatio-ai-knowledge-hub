You can view the system operations audit log that automatically registers events
related to the modification of user roles, distribution of access permissions,
change of system setting values, and users' authorization in the system.

## Access the audit log​

Open the System designer. For example, click the
![system_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/logging_tools/BPMonlineHelp/view_and_archive_audit_log/system_designer.png)
button. Then, open the "System settings" section in the "System setup" block.
Click "Audit log" in the "Users and administration" block.

Example

Enable the "View "Audit log" section" ("CanViewSysOperationAudit" code) system
operation to view the audit log. Enable the "Manage "Audit log" section"
("CanViewSysOperationAudit" code) system operation to view and archive the audit
log records. Learn more:
[System operation permissions](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2000).

The **Audit log** view displays the list of the most recently logged events. The
**Log archive** view displays the list of events archived via the **Archive
log** action. Creatio stores the archived events in a separate table.

The **Audit log** section list displays the following data:

Example

Configure the balancer to make the audit log display the user IP addresses in
Creatio .NET deployed on-site with horizontal scaling. Learn more:
[Set up the IP addresses in the audit log for .NET](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2110#title-2491-19).

- **Type** – the **Event types** lookup contains the available event types. For
  example, "User authorization," "User session," etc.

- **Event date** – the event start date and time.

- **Result** – the **Event results** lookup contains the available system event
  results. For example, the user login attempt may finish with the
  "Authorization" result or the "Authorization denied" result upon failure.

- **IP address** – the IP address of the user who performed the operation that
  resulted in the event. For example, the IP address of the user who attempted
  to log in to Creatio.

note

If the user connects via a VPN or the request is routed through proxy servers,
the field will list the IP address of each proxy server. In that case, the
rightmost IP address will belong to the last proxy server and the leftmost IP
address will belong to the first traceable server.

- **Owner** – the user who performed the operation that resulted in the event.
  For example, the name of the employee who attempted to log in to Creatio.

- **Description** – the detailed event description. For example, "User
  authorization John Best. IP address: 192.168.0.7." Creatio generates the event
  description automatically.

## Archive the audit log​

The **Archive log** action in the system operation audit log copies the log
records to a separate archive table.

To archive the audit log:

1. Click
   ![audit_log_list_view.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/logging_tools/BPMonlineHelp/view_and_archive_audit_log/audit_log_list_view.png)
   to open the list view of the **Audit log** section.

2. Click **Actions** → **Archive log**.

3. Set up the parameters on the newly opened **Archive parameters** page (Fig.
   2).

4. **Period from** , **till** – specify the period of the events to archive.
   Creatio will only archive the events within the specified range.

5. **Type** – specify the type of the events to archive. Creatio will archive
   only the events of the specified types. You can select multiple types.

note

The archiving action is logged as "Access rights audit log." Creatio will
display a message with the number of archived records upon completion.

As a result, you will be able to see the list of archived events whose dates
fall within the specified period in the "Log archive" view
(![audit_log_archive_view.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/logging_tools/BPMonlineHelp/view_and_archive_audit_log/audit_log_archive_view.png))
of the **Audit log** section.
