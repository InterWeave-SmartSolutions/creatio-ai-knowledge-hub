## Side panel (1)​

The side panel (or the section panel) is in the left and lets you navigate
through the workplaces and sections. Also, the side panel contains quick access
buttons for basic Creatio operations.

### Side panel buttons​

![btn_com_main_menu.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_interface/btn_com_main_menu.png)
is the main menu that contains the index of additional commands:

- **Main menu** opens the main Creatio page. The main page contains the index of
  Creatio sections as well as links to the System Designer and user profile
  page.

- **Run process** opens the process start window.

note

Learn more about the business process automation in the Creatio documentation on
business processes.

- **Collapse section panel** / **Expand section panel** collapse or expand the
  side panel, respectively.

- **Workplace** displays the index of available workplaces. When you change a
  workplace, the index of sections available in the side panel also changes.
  [You can edit](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1248) the indexes of
  workplaces and sections within workplaces.

- **User profile** opens the user profile page that lets you view and edit
  personal Creatio settings.

- **Exit** ends the Creatio session. The command opens the login page.

![btn_com_sidebar_start_process.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_interface/btn_com_sidebar_start_process.png)
is the global process start button. If you did not set up any process for the
button or the processes you set up are inactive, the button opens a window that
contains the index of Creatio business processes. If at least one process you
set up for the button is active, the button opens a menu that contains
additional commands:

- **Run process** is the index of main business processes you can run.

- **Another process** opens a window that contains the index of Creatio business
  processes.

note

Set up the global process start button in the **Process library** section. Learn
more in a separate article:
[Run a business process](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7097#title-1884-3).

and the icons of the current workplace's sections. The expanded panel displays
action buttons, full section names, and the current workplace's name.

### Select a workplace​

Switch between user workplaces using the menu on the side panel. You can select
the needed workspace in the main menu of the collapsed (Fig. 2) or expanded
(Fig. 3) side panel.

[Command line](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1228) lets you search
for and add records as well as execute other actions by entering text commands.

[data filter](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1017) settings and manage
the section [folder](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1018) tree.

## Working area (5)​

Depending on the section and selected view, the working area displays the
following:

  for example, the contact list in the **Contacts** section
- the [page](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1765) of the open record
