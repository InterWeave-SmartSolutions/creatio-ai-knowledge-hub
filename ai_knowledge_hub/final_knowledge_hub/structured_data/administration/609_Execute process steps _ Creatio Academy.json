As part of the process, Creatio may prompt you to enter required data, e. g., the results of actions performed outside of Creatio, or to select how a process should continue. The process can perform the steps in the following ways: Automatically. For example, when deleting records that meet the set conditions. With user input. For example, the process opens a record page for you to fill out. In this case, the process will resume when you complete the required actions: filling out and saving the page. If the action that requires your input runs in the background, the process will not perform any logic until you open the corresponding page from the Business process tasks tab of the communication panel. In this case, Creatio will perform all system operations of the process in the background without displaying the loading mask. If such an action does not run in the background, Creatio will open the corresponding page and perform other logic the moment the process starts this action.

Complete process activities ​ If the process creates an activity, the next step will be activated only after you complete the activity with a result. You can limit the list of available results to the values available in the process element. You can assign the activity to another user or role on the activity page. If you cannot complete the activity immediately after its activation, enter the new date and time in the Start and Due fields of the activity page and save the record. You can come back to this step later. note The process activities are available in the Activities section , similarly to manually created records.
