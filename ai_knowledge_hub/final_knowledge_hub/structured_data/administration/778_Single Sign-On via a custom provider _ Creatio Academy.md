Creatio can be integrated with any identity provider that supports the SAML 2.0
protocol. You can use OneLogin SSO portal as a single sign-on point for all your
services, including Creatio. To do this, perform the setup in both OneLogin and
Creatio.

Important

This example uses the `https://site01.creatio.com/` Creatio URL and the "appid"
application ID in OneLogin. Replace these values with your website URL and the
ID of the corresponding application in OneLogin when you perform the actual
setup.

The following **steps** are the general procedure required to set up Single
Sign-On in Creatio:

1. Download the file that contains integration metadata. Read more >>>
2. Perform the setup in your provider. Read more >>>
3. Perform the setup in Creatio. Read more >>>

6. ** Fill out the provider's name** to display on the Creatio login page in the
   **Display name** field.

8. **Turn on Just-In-Time Provisioning** (optional). This mechanism
   automatically creates the corresponding Creatio user account with data from

   company employees data when log in (Just-In-Time Provisioning)** checkbox and

   users data when log in (Just-In-Time Provisioning)** checkbox and map the
   fields (Fig. 2).

   changes.

    open the provider page and click **Test**.

Mobile Creatio lets you log in using the Single Sign-On technology. To set up
SSO authentication for Mobile Creatio, **turn on the "Use SSO in the mobile app"
("MobileUseSSO" code) system setting**.

**If SSO authentication for Mobile Creatio is turned on** , the app displays an
identity provider page that includes the login and password fields.
