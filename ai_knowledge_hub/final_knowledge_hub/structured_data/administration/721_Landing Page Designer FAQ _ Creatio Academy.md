## Is a partnership involved in landing page hosting? Does this imply additional costs for Creatio users who want to create landing pages?​

The pre-configured Creatio domain used for publishing landing pages is
`instantlandings.com`. This functionality is provided free of charge to Creatio
customers. The domain is hosted on Creatio-managed Amazon Route S3
infrastructure, with servers located in the United States.

## Can a landing page created in Landing Page Designer be embedded into another website, for example, as an iframe?​

Yes, you can integrate a Creatio landing page into an external website. The
recommended approach is to use the "Download HTML" feature that provides full
control over what is deployed to the customer’s website. Alternatively, you can
embed the page via an iframe. However, this method might limit visibility for
web analytics tools such as Google Analytics or Matomo.

## Can I integrate the new landing page functionality into a marketing campaign, with different paths depending on responses submitted through the landing page?​

Yes, this is fully supported. You can use either the **Add from web page** or
**Web page** campaign elements to incorporate landing page interactions into
your marketing workflows. Learn more:
[Campaign element reference](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1487#title-347-80).

## Can​ I set up a landing page in Creatio that stores submissions in a custom object?​

Yes, it is possible. Add the object to the "Webhook entities" lookup, then use
the **Form settings** button in the form setup area and select the object in the
window that opens.

## How does the Add new field button in the form setup area work?​

This button lets you add fields selected in the menu of the **Form settings**
button.
