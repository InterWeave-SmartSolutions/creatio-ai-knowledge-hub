  "content": "Version: 8.3 On this page How can I provide all users with the same licenses? ​ You can distribute licenses manually in the License manager or System users sections.  Alternatively, bind all needed licenses to the \"All employees\" role so that licences are distributed automatically during LDAP synchronization or Single Sign-On provisioning . In both cases your colleagues will receive the same list of licenses. How can I distribute different platform licenses for different user groups? ​ If you have multiple different platform licenses you can use a role-based license distribution approach to provide different user groups with different licenses. For example, you have \"studio creatio unlimited plan cloud\", \"studio creatio limited internal cloud\", \"studio creatio self-service portal cloud\" licenses and \"Accountant department\", \"Office managers\", \"Sales department\" and \"System administrators\" user roles. If employees in \"Accountant department\" role need to work with the Invoices section only, you can provide this role with \"studio creatio limited internal cloud\" license. If employees in \"Office managers\" role need to get service from system administrators only, you can provide them with \"studio creatio self-service portal cloud\" license. Finally, you can bind \"Sales department\" and \"System administrators\" roles with \"studio creatio unlimited plan cloud\" license to provide them with full access to the platform capabilities. Alternatively, you can bind these licenses to functional roles and give the roles to appropriate departments. How can I provide different users with licenses for different Creatio products and apps? ​ If you use Creatio to automate work of different functional departments of your company, you can simply provide different user groups with different licenses for Creatio products and composable apps using role-based license distribution approach. To do this you can bind your platform license to the root role like \"All employees\" and distribute product licenses to  child roles. For example, you can issue license \"Marketing creatio product cloud\" license to marketing department, \"Sales creatio product cloud\" to sales department, and \"Service creatio product cloud\" to service department. In this case company employees will receive the licenses they need based on the department and the list of issued licenses will be updated if somebody changes department. How can I migrate to role-based license distribution approach? ​ You can migrate to new role-based license distribution mechanisms starting from Creatio 8.1.3. You can do that partially, for example by adding licenses only for some user roles like \"System administrators,\" and start to use new functionality with them. In this case only this user group will receive licenses based on the new mechanism and distribution for all other users will remain the same. Instructions: Manage user licenses . Do I need to provide user types with limited access like external B2C or limited internal with separate licenses for Creatio composable apps? ​ Creatio products like Sales or Marketing come with licenses that grant users access to all features within them, including composable apps. You do not need separate licenses for these built-in apps. However, if you purchase an additional composable app not included in your main product (like adding Case Management to Sales Creatio), separate licenses are required. This applies to full user, and self-service licenses. At the same time, you can grant access to specific sections within any Creatio product or app to users hat have external B2B, external B2C, mobile-only or limited Internal licenses without additional licenses for that specific app. See also ​ Creatio licensing Manage user licenses How can I provide all users with the same licenses?
