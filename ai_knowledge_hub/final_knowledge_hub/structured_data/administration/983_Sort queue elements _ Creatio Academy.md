You can customize the display order of the queue records by applying sorting
values for one or several columns of the queue object. For example, you can
configure the cases to display in the ascending order of the registration date.
The queue priority also influences the way records are sorted.

You can customize queues:

1. By queue priority (if an agent works with several queues with the same queue
   object).

2. By sorting parameters specified in the object. The parameters configuration
   applies to all queues generated by the current object.

article.

note

Display cases with a high priority that were created earlier on the agent
desktop. To do this, set up the sorting conditions for the cases by priority and
then by registration date.

To do this:

To change the sort order, use the

enterprise/service
enterprise/7.16.0/BPMonlineHelp/section_supervisor/btn_up.png) and
![btn_down.png](<https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documents/docs/product/bpm'online%20service>
enterprise/service
enterprise/7.16.0/BPMonlineHelp/section_supervisor/btn_down.png) buttons.

1. Go to the **Queues** section.

2. Click
   ![btn_com_settings_view.png](<https://academy.creatio.com/sites/default/files/documents/docs/product/bpm'online%20service>
   enterprise/service
   enterprise/7.16.0/BPMonlineHelp/section_supervisor/btn_com_settings_view.png)
   to open the **Queues setup** view.

3. Click **Actions** → **Queue sorting setup**.

4. Select the "Case" object and click **Settings** (Fig. 1).

![Fig. 1 Selecting the object in the lookup](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/2020-11/scr_section_supervisor_choosing_object.png)

5. n the new window, click **+** to add a case column for sorting. For example,
   add the **Priority** column.

6. Select the "Ascending" sorting order to high-priority cases display first.
   Creatio will sort the records alphabetically. To sort the records by origin
   in a specific order, add a number before each entry in the **Case source**
   lookup. For example, "1. Critical", "2. High."

7. Save the settings by clicking **Apply** (Fig. 2).

8. Similarly, add the **Registration date** column. Use the ascending sorting
   order.

9. Specify the priority of the columns to sort the records by. The sorting is
   first performed by the column with a higher position. In this case, Creatio
   sorts the records by the **Priority** column first, then by the
   **Registration date** column (Fig. 3).

10. Click **Close**.

As a result, the agent desktop will display critical records first, then
high-priority records, and so on. The earliest records will be displayed before
the latest records of the same priority.
