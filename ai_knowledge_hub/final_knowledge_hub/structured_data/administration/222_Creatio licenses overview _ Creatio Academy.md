Creatio includes multiple license types based on the type of licensed object:

- **Personal licenses** provide access to Creatio platform and products for
  specific users. These licenses are linked to user accounts. When distributing
  personal licenses, make sure the number of provided licenses does not exceed
  the number of purchased licenses. Read more >>>

- **Server licenses** provide access to additional Creatio functionality, for
  example, phone integration, to all users on the server. Unlike personal
  licenses, server licenses are not limited by the number of users.

  licenses. Make sure that the number of used licenses does not exceed the
  number of available licenses. Read more >>>

## Marketing Creatio licenses​

You need the following additional licenses to work with **Marketing Creatio**
and **Creatio CRM bundle** :

- **Marketing campaign** licenses ("marketing creatio"). Enable access to all
  sections of the Marketing Creatio product. The number of licenses must
  correspond to the number of Creatio users.
- **Active marketing contact** licenses ("marketing creatio 1000 active
  contacts"). Enable creating records in the **Email** , **Campaigns** , and
  **Events** sections. The number of licenses must be equal to or higher than
  the number of active contacts who receive marketing communications (emails,
  campaigns, or events).

note

License names include prefixes that specify the Creatio deployment method:
onsite or cloud. Cloud licenses do not apply to Creatio on-site and vice versa.

**Active contacts** are contacts who have had at least 1 of the following types
of marketing communications within the last year:

- A contact was a part of an email audience and the email sent to the contact
  had a response from the user, for example, open or click.
- A contact was a part of an event audience.
- A contact was a part of a campaign audience.
- A contact is a part of a loyalty program and they made at least 1 purchase
  within the last year (if you use Creatio Marketplace products that automate
  loyalty programs).

Licenses are valid within the **licensing period**. The licensing period lasts
for 365 days, starting from the license start date and ending on the date
specified as "Due date" in the License Manager.

The contact can become active only once during a licensing period. If the
contact was active during a previous licensing period, but they did not receive
any marketing communications during the current period, Creatio does not
consider the contact as active during the current period.

**Make sure that the number of active contacts (used licenses) does not exceed
the number of available licenses**.

If the number of used licenses exceeds that of the available licenses, errors
might occur during the following:

- saving or sending emails
- editing email templates in the Content Designer
- advancing a campaign to the **Marketing email** step
- certain operations in the **Events** and **Campaigns** sections might be
  disabled

Creatio notifies the users when the number of available active contact licenses
becomes lower than the threshold percentage of the total number of paid
licenses, 10% by default. Notifications are sent only to system users whose
contacts are owners or creators of emails, campaigns, events over the past 30
days. We recommend such users to **check the**Notifications** tab** of the
Communication panel regularly.

note

You can change the threshold percentage in the "Active contacts - warning
threshold (%)" ("ActiveContactsWarningThreshold" code) system setting.

If the number of active contacts exceeds the number of purchased licenses, you
need to purchase additional licenses. Send a license request to Creatio
technical support team.

The following guidelines will help **avoid restrictions and errors caused by the
lack of available licenses** :

- When adding groups of contacts to email participants make sure to check the
  filters of corresponding contact folders. If the filters have been modified,
  participants who are not a part of the email target audience might be included
  in the folder. Creatio calculates the number of active contacts and available
  licenses regularly (once every 4 hours), and additionally each time after an
  email is sent. That is why the notification about insufficient licenses might
  be missing when you form the email audience.

- If the number of active contacts does not exceed the available licenses at the
  moment of sending an email, Creatio sends emails to each of the recipients
  from the audience. For example, you have 10000 licenses and 9999 active
  contacts. You add 50000 recipients to the email audience. In this case, email
  messages are sent to all contacts from the audience. After sending the email,
  Creatio checks the license availability and applies licensing limitations if
  necessary.

- When sending emails, be sure to check the settings that let you manage the
  sending operation and restrict sending emails to inactive contacts, namely:
  - Prohibition to use a contact’s email address (the **Do not use Email**
    checkbox in the **Communication options** of the contact).
  - Ability to subscribe to certain email types as well as unsubscribe from
    them.

#### Check the number of used active contact licenses​

The number of owned licenses and active contacts is available in the
**Dashboards** section, on the **Licenses** tab (Fig. 3). These metrics might
slightly differ from the actual data since they are calculated once an hour.
Since Creatio version 8.0.2 the indicators also display license end dates.

You can view the total number of marketing contact licenses and number of
available licenses on tooltip on the list page and record page of the **Email**
, **Campaigns** , **Events** sections as well. The tooltip color depends on the
number of available licenses and varies from green (sufficient licenses) to red
(no vacant licenses). These numbers might slightly differ from the actual data
since they are calculated once an hour.

Creatio checks license availability on schedule or after sending an email. We
recommend checking the number of available licenses manually when you prepare a
new email communication with customers.

To view the list of active contacts, set up a filter in the **Contacts** section
as shown in Fig. 5.

Important

The filter does not include the loyalty program participants.

The "Created on" date in the filter is the date when the licenses were uploaded
to Creatio. To calculate the needed date:

![Fig. 6 View the license validity term](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/licensing/scr_chapter_licensing_term_of_validity.png)

1. Click
   ![btn_system_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/academy_en/files/images/Setup_and_Administration/creatio_licensing/btn_system_designer_8_shell.png)
   to open the System Designer.
2. Go to the "Users and administration" block → "**License manager**." This
   opens a page.
3. Use the search field to find the needed license by name quickly and view its
   end date on the page that opens (Fig. 6).
4. Copy the start date of the license.

As a result, you will get the start date of the license validity period. Enter
the date in the **Created on** column when setting up the filter that selects
active contacts.
