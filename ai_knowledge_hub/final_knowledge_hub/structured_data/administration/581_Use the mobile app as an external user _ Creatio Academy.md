The **Cases** section lets you:

- Create cases.

- Add images and files required for troubleshooting to cases.

- View details of registered cases.

- Send messages to support specialists.

## Create a new case​

1. Tap the
   ![btn_add.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/mobile_portal/8_1/btn_add.png)
   button. This opens the **New case** window.

2. Fill out the case profile:
   1. Select the case category to accelerate case classification and transfer
      cases to dedicated experts faster:
      “[Service request](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/glossary_page#title-2071-146)”
      or
      “[Incident](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/glossary_page#title-2071-70).”
      The field is required.

   2. Elaborate on the case in the **Description** field (optional).

   3. Attach files to the case (optional). To do this:
      - Tap the
        ![btn_attach.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/mobile_portal/8_1/btn_attach.png)
        **Attach** button.
      - Specify the source of the files to attach.
      - Select the relevant files. Out of the box, you can upload files up to 10
        Mb. The administrator of the main Creatio application can change the
        maximum attachment file size. On the **Attachments** tab of the case
        record, you can view any attachments added when creating the case or as
        part of a conversation with support agent.

3. Tap the
   ![btn_approve.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/mobile_portal/8_1/btn_approve.png)
   button.

As a result, a new case will be created and added to support processing queue
immediately (Fig. 2).

note

We recommend filling out the **Description** field when you create a case to
ensure support agents receive the information required to solve the case. If you
leave the **Description** field empty when you create a case, Creatio will
populate the field with the value of the **Category** field.

## Search for a case​

You can search for a case by description or number in the case list. To search
for cases:

1. Tap the
   ![btn_search.png](https://d3a7ykdi65m4cy.cloudfront.net/ac-en/s3fs-public/images/Platform_basics/mobile_portal/8_1/btn_search.png)
   button at the top of the screen. This opens the search bar.
2. Enter a part of the case number or description in the search bar.
3. The app displays the index of cases that match the search criteria. If the
   app finds no such cases, it displays the “No data” message.
