Can a landing page created in Landing Page Designer be embedded into another website, for example, as an iframe? ​ Yes, you can integrate a Creatio landing page into an external website. The recommended approach is to use the \"Download HTML\" feature that provides full control over what is deployed to the customer’s website. Alternatively, you can embed the page via an iframe.

Can I integrate the new landing page functionality into a marketing campaign, with different paths depending on responses submitted through the landing page? ​ Yes, this is fully supported. You can use either the Add from web page or Web page campaign elements to incorporate landing page interactions into your marketing workflows. Learn more: Campaign element reference .
