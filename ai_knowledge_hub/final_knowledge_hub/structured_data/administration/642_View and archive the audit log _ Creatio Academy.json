Access the audit log ​ Open the System designer. For example, click the button. Then, open the \"System settings\" section in the \"System setup\" block. Click \"Audit log\" in the \"Users and administration\" block. Example Enable the \"View \"Audit log\" section\" (\"CanViewSysOperationAudit\" code) system operation to view the audit log.

The Audit log view displays the list of the most recently logged events. The Log archive view displays the list of events archived via the Archive log action. Creatio stores the archived events in a separate table. The Audit log section list displays the following data: Example Configure the balancer to make the audit log display the user IP addresses in Creatio .NET deployed on-site with horizontal scaling. Learn more: Set up the IP addresses in the audit log for .NET . Type – the Event types lookup contains the available event types. For example, \"User authorization,\" \"User session,\" etc. Event date – the event start date and time. Result – the Event results lookup contains the available system event results. For example, the user login attempt may finish with the \"Authorization\" result or the \"Authorization denied\" result upon failure. IP address – the IP address of the user who performed the operation that resulted in the event. For example, the IP address of the user who attempted to log in to Creatio. note If the user connects via a VPN or the request is routed through proxy servers, the field will list the IP address of each proxy server. In that case, the rightmost IP address will belong to the last proxy server and the leftmost IP address will belong to the first traceable server.
