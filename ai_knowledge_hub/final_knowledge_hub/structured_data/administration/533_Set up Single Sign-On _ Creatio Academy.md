## Description

The Single Sign-On technology in Creatio enables users to log in to multiple
services using a single account. After a user signs in once via an identity
provider, they can access their applications and services without the need to
enter their login credentials. When a user signs out of any of the applications,
any sessions in other, connected applications end as well.

## Key Concepts

configuration, section, detail, integration, account

## Use Cases

building applications, custom development, API integration, system
administration, user management

The Single Sign-On technology in Creatio enables users to log in to multiple
services using a single account. After a user signs in once via an identity
provider, they can access their applications and services without the need to
enter their login credentials. When a user signs out of any of the applications,
any sessions in other, connected applications end as well.

**Prerequisites** :

1. A Creatio website available over HTTPS.
2. Administrator privileges on the website.
3. Administrator privileges in the identity provider.
4. Users in the corporate domain.

You can expedite the setup by using one of the following pre-configured
providers:

- AD FS
- Azure AD
- Okta
- Cognito
- Google

You can also integrate Creatio with any identity provider that supports the SAML
2.0 protocol.

For detailed instructions, check out the individual provider articles. In
general, the **following steps** are required to set up Single Sign-On:

1. Download the file that contains integration metadata.
2. Set up the identity provider by adding Creatio to trusted websites.
3. Set up the trusted identity provider in Creatio.

## SSL Certificate​

An SSL Certificate is used for signing and encrypting SAML requests sent to the
SSO provider. SAML requests, outlined below in the next section, are mandatory.

You can upload a public Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Certificate to sign and
encrypt SAML requests by clicking the Upload Certificate button (Fig. 1).

## SAML Request Validation​

SAML requests signing is a minimum required option for secure SSO configuration.
An SSO configuration without SAML requests signing is considered vulnerable, and
will be automatically disabled.

To validate the signing of any SAML requests, select the **Signature
Validation** checkbox (Fig. 2).

Important

We strongly recommend not using SSO login without SAML signing or SAML
encryption. This configuration is insecure and should be used exclusively in
development environments.

## Display login via SSO​

You can specify where the user will see the **Login via SSO** link depending on
their user type, with the main login page, the login page for external users, or
both as the available options. This option allows you to enable SSO login
exclusively for a specific group of users. To specify its location, perform its
set up in the **User Type** field of the **Additional Parameters** section of an
individual SSO provider's page (Fig. 3).

## Import SSO Configuration​

You can also import the configuration of your SSO provider from an existing SSO
metadata file. Importing the configuration this way greatly simplifies the SSO
setup. This functionality allows you to quickly and efficiently create either a
new SSO provider, or to update an existing provider. To do this, you need a
metadata file, which is a specifically formatted XML file that contains all the
required information for setting SSO up on Creatio's side, and the SSL
Certificate to be installed. An overwhelming majority of SSO providers supports
this functionality. After you upload the metadata file (Fig. 4), Creatio
automatically adds all the settings, including the SSO certificate for signing
and encryption of your SAML requests.

## turn SLO for SSO off​

You can turn Single Logout (SLO) off in your SSO configuration. This is an
entirely optional option, and not mandatory. If SLO is turned off, the user is
only logged out from Creatio upon logging out from Creatio. If SLO is turned on
on the other hand, the user is logged out from all services that use the
corresponding SSO service (Fig. 5).
