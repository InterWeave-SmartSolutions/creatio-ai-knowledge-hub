Creatio cloud users can set up secure remote access for Creatio technical
support specialists to troubleshoot and resolve cases faster. Remote access
sessions will not compromise your personal and commercial data security since
you do not have to share your login credentials with support.

note

Remote support sessions use the following system settings: "Default external
access client id" (DefaultExternalAccessClientId), "Identity server client
secret" (IdentityServerClientSecret), Identity server Url (IdentityServerUrl),
"Identity server client id" (IdentityServerClientId). The values in these system
settings are populated automatically.

- To hide section record data from the technical support specialists, use the
  **data isolation mode**.
- To restrict technical support specialists from modifying configuration
  settings, use the **configuration restriction mode**. The support specialists
  will still have permission to read configuration settings needed to resolve
  the customer’s case.

To enable remote support access, a user must have system administrator
privileges (have the "System administrators" role). Technical support
specialists can connect remotely under the administrator account or the account
of any other application user. All remote support session data are logged and
can be retrieved later. Logged connection data include the time of the
connection and information on which data were modified during the session.

## Set up remote sessions​

1. Click
   ![btn_help_1.png](https://academy.creatio.com/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/external_access/btn_help_1.png)
   → "Grant access to support" in the upper right corner of the application
   window. ([Fig. 1](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_42442_487))

note

To grant access to support, you need permissions to read and add records in the
"External access" object. Users with the "System administrators" role have these
permissions by default. Learn more about object operation permissions in the
"[Managing object operation permissions](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=administration&ver=7&id=262)"
article.

2. Fill out the displayed mini page
   ([Fig. 2](https://academy.creatio.com#XREF_82683_487)):

3. In the **Reason to grant access** field, specify what problem requires
   granting access to support, the request number, or the list of services a
   technical support specialist has to provide.

4. In the **Access close date** field, specify the date when the granted access
   expires. Granted access will expire at 11:59 PM on the specified date.

5. In the **Grantor** field, the user who is granting access is specified by
   default. You can specify a different user account to use by technical support
   specialists for accessing your application.

6. Select or clear the **Deny access to data** and **Deny configuration**
   checkboxes to enable or disable the data isolation mode and configuration
   restriction mode respectively. By default, both checkboxes are selected. This
   means that a technical support specialist will not be able to see your
   section record data or configure the system.
   - If you need the technical support specialist to have the same permissions
     as the user under whose account remote access is granted, clear both of the
     checkboxes.
   - If you need the technical support specialist to modify the current
     configuration without being able to see your records, only clear the **Deny
     configuration** checkbox. The technical support specialist will also be
     able to access the System designer functions required for updating
     configuration (for instance, the **Lookups** , **Advanced settings** ,
     **Process library** sections and more). The record data in the main
     sections will remain unavailable to the Creatio support.
   - If you need the technical support specialist to be able to access your
     records without being able to modify the configuration of the system, you
     should only clear the **Deny access to data** checkbox. In this case,
     Creatio support will be able to access the system configuration in the
     read-only mode.

7. Save the record.

As a result, a new record will be added in the **External access** section.
Technical support specialists will be able to log in under the user account
specified as the **Grantor**. Support specialists will not need login
credentials. The specialists will have access to the corresponding permissions
not otherwise restricted in the sessions settings. The remote access session
will expire on the specified date at 11:59 PM.
