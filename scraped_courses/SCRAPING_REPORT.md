# Course Scraping Report - Creatio Academy

## Summary

- **Date**: August 1, 2025
- **Total Courses Processed**: 33 courses (all courses from the initial catalog)
- **Status**: All courses successfully scraped, but limited content available
  without login

## Key Findings

### Access Limitations

The Creatio Academy platform requires user authentication to access detailed
course content including:

- Course descriptions
- Prerequisites
- Learning objectives
- Downloadable materials (PDFs, slides)
- Video content

### Data Collected

#### 1. Course Metadata

For each course, we successfully extracted:

- Course title
- Course URL
- Category (Instructor-led Training vs E-Learning)
- Duration information
- Level (where available)
- Format (Online, etc.)

#### 2. Page Structure

- Basic page HTML structure
- Navigation elements
- Limited publicly available content

#### 3. Video Links

- Found YouTube channel links (https://www.youtube.com/c/creatio)
- No embedded course-specific videos accessible without login

## Technical Details

### Scraping Approach

1. Used BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
2. Implemented robust error handling
3. Created organized folder structure for each course
4. Attempted to extract:
   - Meta descriptions
   - Prerequisites sections
   - Learning objectives
   - PDF/document links
   - Video embeds
   - Slide presentations

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Authentication Wall**: Most course content is behind a login requirement
2. **Limited Public Content**: Only basic course information is publicly
   accessible
3. **No Direct Downloads**: No PDFs, slides, or other materials were publicly
   available

## Recommendations

### For Complete Content Access

1. **Create Account**: Register for a Creatio Academy account
2. **Authentication Integration**: Implement login functionality in the scraper
3. **Session Management**: Handle cookies and session tokens for authenticated
   requests

### Alternative Approaches

1. **Public Resources**: Focus on Creatio's public documentation and YouTube
   channel
2. **Community Content**: Explore Creatio Community forums for publicly
   available materials
3. **API Access**: Check if Creatio offers an API for accessing course content

## Data Files Created

1. **scraping_summary.json**: Complete log of all scraping activities
2. **course_details.json**: Individual JSON files for each course with available
   metadata
3. **video_urls.txt**: Links to general Creatio YouTube channel (no
   course-specific videos found)

## Next Steps

To access the full course content, you would need to:

1. Create a Creatio Academy account
2. Modify the scraper to handle authentication
3. Re-run the scraping process with authenticated sessions
4. Implement proper rate limiting to respect the platform's terms of service

## Conclusion

While we successfully created a comprehensive scraping infrastructure and
processed all 33 courses, the actual content extraction was limited due to
authentication requirements. The scraper is fully functional and ready to
extract detailed content once authentication is implemented.
