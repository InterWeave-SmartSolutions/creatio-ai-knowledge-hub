# Creatio Development Environment Setup Complete

## ✅ Task 7: Development Environment Integration - COMPLETED

### 🎯 What Was Accomplished

**1. Visual Studio Code Configuration**
- ✅ Created `.vscode/extensions.json` with comprehensive Creatio-specific extensions
- ✅ Configured `.vscode/settings.json` with optimized editor settings
- ✅ Added file associations for Creatio file types (.cs, .json, .config, etc.)

**2. ESLint and Code Formatting Rules**
- ✅ Set up `.eslintrc.js` with Creatio-specific linting rules
- ✅ Configured `.eslintignore` to exclude appropriate files
- ✅ Integrated ESLint with VS Code for real-time code quality feedback

**3. Prettier Code Formatting**
- ✅ Created `.prettierrc.js` with consistent formatting rules
- ✅ Added `.prettierignore` for proper file exclusions
- ✅ File-specific formatting overrides for different file types

**4. TypeScript Configuration**
- ✅ Configured `tsconfig.json` with AMD modules (Creatio-compatible)
- ✅ Added path mapping for clean imports
- ✅ Strict type checking with proper compiler options

**5. Project Templates and Boilerplate Code**
- ✅ Created comprehensive client schema template (`templates/client-modules/ClientSchemaTemplate.js`)
- ✅ Built entity schema template with event listeners (`templates/entity-schemas/EntitySchemaTemplate.cs`)
- ✅ Added TypeScript definitions for Creatio platform (`src/types/creatio.d.ts`)

**6. Git Version Control Integration**
- ✅ Initialized Git repository
- ✅ Created comprehensive `.gitignore` for Creatio projects
- ✅ Set up Husky for Git hooks
- ✅ Configured lint-staged for pre-commit code quality checks

**7. Debugging Configurations**
- ✅ Created `.vscode/launch.json` with multiple debug configurations:
  - Chrome debugging for client-side code
  - .NET process attachment for server-side debugging
  - Jest test debugging
  - Node.js script debugging
  - Compound configurations for full-stack debugging

**8. Development Scripts and Tools**
- ✅ Configured `package.json` with comprehensive npm scripts
- ✅ Created setup script (`scripts/setup-dev.sh`) for automated environment setup
- ✅ Added EditorConfig (`.editorconfig`) for consistent editor behavior

**9. Documentation**
- ✅ Created comprehensive development guide (`DEVELOPMENT.md`)
- ✅ Included troubleshooting section and best practices
- ✅ Added setup instructions and usage examples
