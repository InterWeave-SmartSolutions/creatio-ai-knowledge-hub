    "content": "# Speaker 1\n\nSo today's day five of our development on Creature platform guided learning and we continue to work with some \nparts of Creature user interface slightly moving forward to so to study some server side items. And also I need to tell \nyou about Classic UI and possibly you'll be interested in migration from Classic UI to the Freedom ui. So what I need \nto tell you first today, this is about details. Because this is a very important piece of Creature configuration and you \nwill face it almost everywhere. Let me show you what detail is go to customer 360 because it's a good example of \ndetails. We go to accounts section and then we can open any account record. Detail is separate entity which keeps \nsome data in connection to our main record. Here we can see an example. Main record is account and detail is \naccount address.",

    "content": "# Speaker 1\n\nAnd you can see that for one main account record we can save unlimited number of addresses. So we can put \nunlimited number of addresses here and they will be usually displayed in a list. And the reason why Creature has \ndetails is need to save additional data in connection to our main entity. So our main entity is a single record and then \nwe need to keep information for example about different types of addresses for our customer or different emails. Or \nmaybe it's just simple list of contacts connected to this account. So you should understand that detail is usually \nbased on a separate entity. So account is one entity, Account address is a separate entity, it means separate object \nand it means separate physical date table. Usually we have one too many relationship between details and main \nrecords.",

Vikrat, thank you very much for confirmation. Thank you for working \nwith your redis and I'm really happy that you finally made your system working correctly. Thank you. And so details, \nthey are usually connected with main entity with the help of lookups, lookup columns. And each detail record has \ninformation about its parent account. And that's how system can filter through all addresses and show only \naddresses related to this currently selected data record. Details are very common in creation. If you will turn on \nbigger product like sales service and marketing, you will see details almost everywhere. And we have big entities like \ncontacts or accounts and they have plenty of details like addresses in accounts.",

We also have detail named job experience. And when we have \nseveral entities, sometimes they are connected with each other with the help of lookups. And that's why and that's \nhow we can make some details. For example, we can look at accounts and see list of connected contacts because \ncontact has a reference to account. Let me show you here Account select. And now you see that we have contacts \nand they have reference to account.",

Maybe some of you will ask about is it possible to make a connection one to one or data connection many to \nmany. Physically this is possible, but you should use for one to one you still will have to use separate object. And for \nmany to many we will have to use supporting additional object which will use two lookups for two connected \nentities. So the easiest to implement and I think the most commonly used case is use of one to many relationship. \nAnd now let's return back. Let's return back to our reality section.

And usually the reason why developers create replacing objects is need to add your own columns. \nSometimes replacing object is created because you want to change some common properties like title of the object, \nlike some behavior settings or maybe change of access rights settings. When you replace an object, you can modify \naccess rights behavior change. And we have three types of access rights permissions related to objects in creation. \nAccess rights set for general operations to Allow or disable selection, insert, update or delete operation for the \nobject.",

So three levels of access rights protection and when you make a \nreplacement object you can also change such permission set.
