Today we will prepare with \nthe to prepare for the certification for the development exam. And this is an optional thing. So if you want, if you feel \nyourself ready for this, you can apply for this type of check certification. And as you are members of our guided \nlearning, so you can run fast track certification for free. And I will explain what certification is, how it's held and what \nyou should do for it, how to prepare. So all the certification steps we will discuss today and I hope it will be clear. So \nin general, the main purpose what is certification? This is a test. It's a check of your knowledge and skills. And we \nhave some certification basics displayed at academy.academy.creation.com Go to certification if you're interested in \ndevelopment certification.",

And being a certified creation developer gives you some \nadvantages. One of the obvious advantage is that you can ask for help at support team at creation support team \nwith the questions related to development like how can I do something like this if you have no your own certificate \nDeveloper certificate support team will reject you on such questions. But if you are certified developer and you \nrepresent company with a paid support plan, so your company should pay some money to support for support.",

And now you see one more connection for \nWebSocket was issued was initialized. So it's interesting that in Windows 10 Home Edition and Windows 11 Home \nEdition there are some limitations in IIS on number of WebSocket channels that can be opened. And that's why you \nhave some significant limitations in working with creatio. So it only works when one page is open of creature. So it's \nconnected with WebSocket connections and also even when you work with single page.\n\n--- Page 8 ---",

So that's how you can track WebSocket \nmessages. You can use some filters here. You can type some messages in order to filter because you may have \nplenty of different WebSocket messages and you may need to filter only necessary ones. And can we get the link? \nOh yeah, sorry. This is the link. Yes, thank you, Patty. Here is the link.

By the way, this example is not perfect because here Ryan sends message to \nall users and this is not perfect.

Between client side modules. There are some technical details about \nit. So just for your reference I will answer. I will provide you the link. But let's go closer to the question. So there are \ndifferent types of client side sandbox messages. Point to point messages which are designed to be triggered and \nthen processed and broadcast messages which can be triggered and then processed in many places. In general, \nmessage means some piece of information that is submitted from one module and then possibly can be like\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\nprocessed or taken by other modules. Modules have no information between each other about each other. And there \nis a central dispatcher called Sandbox which is capable to handle such messages and properly dispatch them.",

So kind of a person who can initiate this message. It's called publisher. So a person. So in our \ncase it's a module which like Start asks system to run some particular functionality and it means publishing a \nmessage. Message can be correctly described in the body of client module. And we have methods to register and \nthen to publish it. So it's like initialize initiated and ask system to run it. We ask Sandbox.
