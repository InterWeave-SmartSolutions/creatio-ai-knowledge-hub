So validation should include coding at client side.\n  - We already discussed how to do this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo validation we already discussed you may watch our previous videos if you skipped it and you will know how to do \nthis calculation is about edit page online let's say runtime calculation that we did also in JavaScript and we made the \ncalculation of commission depending on price and offer type.\n  - Let me show you we did it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nPlease note we have a bit different percentage of prices and for center for rentals and for sales, so take care to \nprovide correct values here.\n  - So this is important and we will check it the next task is about C Sharp programming \nmake your own back service club.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIn your homework exam it will be minimum price calculation so they're easy to change but you have to perform this \nstuff in and that's why your homework sorry that's why your everyday work and your results of work at our sessions \nwill be important and it's so it will be useful for your exam and we already discussed how you can write such code.\n  - We used Visual Studio to facilitate our development and make it really easy with the help of background syntax \ncheck, intellisense, autocomplete coloring and also if you're interested, you can study the structure of this project \nand understand a bit more how it was done and generally project files and all the preparations made by creation.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOf course you may use so it's expected that you will use your local instance if you have no any conditions to run \nlocal instance.\n  - You can use cloud one trial environment or dedicated demo environment if you have so you can do \nthis in any kind of environments and it will work for you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAlso we have a task number six which is a bit additional one.\n  - It's about business processes.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd also I didn't tell you important thing that if you are a member of a partner company it makes big sense to get \nmany certified professionals at your partner company because it impacts on your partnership level.\n  - And partnership \nlevel is something about margins, about deals and money sharing between partner company and creation company.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo if partner has not so many experts and certified professionals then such partner will have less partnership level.\n  - And probably this is more risky for creature when any kind of agreement will be signed with a real customer \nincluding partner part of work.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAfter you add this data, let me show you and remind you how we can do this.\n  - So it will be very quick and easy.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe already used this process to add data.\n  - When new record was added, we used start signal item for it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo we can register such parameter as you remember, parameters are like variables at our process.\n  - And in case if we \nstart our process manually so we can call it manual start, if we do it manually, then we expect that this parameter \nwill be filled in and then we can just move on to our step where we add data and then we can replace here parent \nrealty not from signal but from this parameter.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nYou can see it's not so hard and it's very important for you to become familiar and to feel some confidence when you \nwork with processes because this is like a brick game, like a Lego, which you can use for much more complicated \nProcesses and business logic.\n  - If you understand well how such tools work, if you make your own simple examples \nand understand it clearly, then you can use it for much more complicated things and you can use it quite efficiently.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo we can look at its title or at icon type that will help us to get it.\n  - And the only suitable parameter from a signal is \nunique identifier of record double click and that's how we will get this data and save it as formula value.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut we can start this process manually.\n  - So of course we have to save it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, little bit plus will be a good example and add visits menu item will be our unique element code.\n  - This will help \nus to easily find this item in view config diff part of the JavaScript code for our client module.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAs you can see it works, so let's try to run it.\n  - Process successfully started.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nI will explain how you can do this so we can close unnecessary tabs.\n  - Let's go to search for objects and find reality \nVisit object.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it was generally intended to be used for updates.\n  - Situation when you have a record it was already opened at client \nside and you change the data columns of the record at server side.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe need to use some good examples.\n  - So let's delete all the data records.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo if you do something like this and your end user will see the detailed data changed, so it will be quite good enough \nto display that data was modified and you see how it works.\n  - So also it's interesting to mention that it works for \ninsert, it works for updates, but unfortunately for some unknown reason it doesn't work for delete.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf you want to display and demonstrate more skills, you can also try to use a bit more complicated approach with the \nweb sockets with messaging from server side to the client side.\n  - I can quickly explain you how you can do this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo we can use it for free.\n  - And the main idea is that we can.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLet me show you when page of creature is opened.\n  - You can also see we have some WebSocket hard beat and it's \nused to check that WebSocket connection is alive or not.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd one of the specific message tells client side that we have to show some specific process driven page.\n  - So \nsystem should show another page instead of current one.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, this one probably will better.\n  - So let me explain how it can be useful.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt has some corresponding data parameters which will be enough for client side to understand what it talks about.\n  - And as you can see, we have some values here that are enough.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOh, you don't see it here easily because we opened browser developer to wait.\n  - Okay, let's open it again.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut when you start to design business rules, I faced situation when managing business rules requires additional \nwebsocket connections and it also failed in Windows Home version.\n  - So that's how you can track WebSocket \nmessages.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut this is like a technical possibility for you to listen for this websocket at client side.\n  - You also need to know how to \nsend messages at server side to the client side.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo I think it's more efficient, it's more correct and like more fair to send messages only for current user because \nusually you need to do in like connection exactly to current user, not to anyone.\n  - And if you imagine working with \nthousands of end users, so it will be really noisy for them to see such messages that are not intended.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSender is a text MSG body as a text and such command will It's a C sharp and it will send the websocket message \nfrom server side to the client side.\n  - In the client side you can subscribe for it and this is classic UI example.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThis type of messaging can be important in case if you don't really need live update or if you want to make some \nsignificant changes to server side and then run your necessary comments to update client side only once, which \nmeans to be a bit more correct to do.\n  - For example, if you add 100 records at server side, then you ask client side to \nupdate once, which will be definitely better than asking client side to update hundred of times because of live update \noption.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, let's go back to our general certification.\n  - So it was just about this advanced part of the homework.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd before we continue, possibly let's make it five or up to 10 minutes break today.\n  - Today's Friday, all of you are a bit \ntired.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo 50 for the homework and also 50 for your test.\n  - Depending on the type of the test, there are different number of \nquestions.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo I'm trying to explain that in your self assessment test you will have slightly different so different results from the \nsame answers if you do it on the exam.\n  - And self assessment test is harder and real exam is easier.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd also you will face questions with single choice like radio button with circles on the letters not squares.\n  - And we \nhave to answer this test properly and correctly.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo this is about this setting and what are the purpose?\n  - So this purpose is a redis database number.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThis is about very old times when you can use such system setting.\n  - And I can show you examples.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow we use the sum default values for real t classic types.\n  - So we used it here columns code autonumber and we \nuse the auto number prefix number of digits and that's how this numbering can be implemented now in current \nenvironment version.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThank you to.\n  - Okay, so proper transfer of changes target database.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nI have a quick question about the multiple choice questions, if that's okay.\n  - Yes, yes, please.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIn general, it's not so good and it's not recommended because they can temporarily do some violation like you made \nstart to compile and another developer will see hanging of the website.\n  - So this is something that it's better to avoid \nand interfere with other developers.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut for this test you will always get random 28 questions from different categories.\n  - It means that if you want to \nprepare better, you need to run this test more than once.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNo, it's not true.\n  - When truncate is called table is completely cleared and deletes every record separately row by row.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThe reason is that packages cannot be embedded into each other.\n  - So packages cannot be included into another \npackage and embedded packages are not allowed.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOne more package architecture question.\n  - If you do not specify dependency in the package, what will happen?\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThis question is about Marketplace applications and this category is on the for advanced level.\n  - So we already \nstudied almost all of proposed marketplace applications.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd we can search functionality for all data access to all data.\n  - By default it's provided for all administrators.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHow do you use custom types?\n  - This is about data contract and data member.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow you cannot see it, but usually it's randomized.\n  - So in order to make it hard to remember, you see that when you \nopen same question next time it shows you randomized options randomized positions of options.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nPlease be careful Disable file design False Enable file design True you should not mix it this one is correct Entity \nschema query you remember this class?\n  - We used it for server side calculations and operating with data Also similar \napproach with client side Entity schema query can be used at JavaScript part with the client side code it can also \nwork if you're interested, you can find other examples.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo how to properly use it?\n  - This is about protection from memory leakage, you remember?\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe did not actually study the entity class and you can study it yourself.\n  - You can find a lot of examples like this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo when you use entity is an instance of an object so in memory and you can use it for data management.\n  - But one \nentity may operate only with one data row at a moment.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo here we have a question about how to apply changes.\n  - Working with entity Obviously this is running of the save \nnetwork.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo rules and details are supported in Classic UI edit pages only and not supported in list pages or they are called \nsection pages.\n  - In section pages, rules and details are not present.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo when we save yes, validation will be triggered when opening page for insert no, but currently we have to review \nthis because when Freedom UI page opens, it also triggers for validation delete no switching focus from field to \nfield.\n  - Yes, we are almost at the end and schema must be used as parent for a section schema.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut for those who work with Classic UI this knowledge I think it's quite actual.\n  - So this section V2 is correct here.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe did not study this.\n  - In Classic UI it makes more sense.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo don't be so upset because each mistakes, each mistake takes 4% from your score.\n  - And when you run self \nassessment test you need to only to see different questions, potential possible answers and practice with it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf you do seven mistakes in this self assessment test, you will lose 28 marks and your final score will be 72.\n  - But don't \nworry because your score in self assessment is not so important as your knowledge of answers of and your \nknowledge of existing questions.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd here is what this is a question from Rakhi and this is about client side programming and we did not study this \npart.\n  - It's about send box Messaging.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd for such purpose, messaging mechanism was designed and this is sandbox messaging mechanism which is \nonly working at client side between modules.\n  - Between client side modules.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo messages, they have different types and correct answers.\n  - Here are point to point message returns an object \nbroadcast messages does not.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nI can quickly show you examples of how it can look like and example of sandbox messaging.\n  - So in such messaging \nwe have an initializer.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSubscriber is a party, so it's a module which declares that it can process certain messages and it also should \nregister them and then this module must subscribe.\n  - Message has its own identifier.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nI think we have to remove this question from the test because it was from very early version 7 settings and it's about \nbind config for properties events for events.\n  - So A is correct here, but we will remove this question soon.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo just make sure your homework looks good, run tests several times and then for example, some of you may apply \nfor the exam and run it next week.\n  - But in general, usually participants need from two till three weeks and this is time \nquite fair which will be totally comfortable for you to prepare for your exam and then run it today you will receive your \nhomework file and please respond at Please respond on my email with your confirmation that you are ready to or \nyou plan to pass FastTrack certification and I will provide you individual date and time of course, taken into \nconsideration your time zone.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo you will receive everything necessary in email.\n  - And when the proper date will come, I will wait for you in Zoom \nsession when you will finally proceed with your test.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAt the end of this period, while your certificate is still valid, you will be able to run recertification, which means \ngetting new certificate by running test only with no homework.\n  - So if you want, when you have current certificate, \nyou'll be able to get new one with a simplified procedure.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYeah, and advanced has 28 theoretical questions, while basic has only 25 theoretical questions.\n  - So Advanced is a \nbit.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd unfortunately such links work only once and that's why we have to generate it each time when participants \nwants to pass an exam.\n  - Oh yes, sorry.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWhen we will have online session, you will show your homework.\n  - We will see if it's working.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\nOh, so you are worried about the business sense of this time, of this type of cultivation.\n  - Or you have some errors in \nexecution?\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo in general, it looks like we have 300 bucks.\n  - 311 bucks per square foot.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it looks like this data was the result of our calculation and it looks like more or less close to reality $300 per \nsquare foot according to our current prices and areas.\n  - So area is used here in this calculation.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYeah, yeah.\n  - Thank you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThen at next step it will go to page parameter here if you do something so if you lost your data something on the \nway so you will see zero and you should debug your process, you should debug your script task.\n  - And we already \ndiscussed how to do this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut I think that regular Certification is a bit more harder and it has different variants.\n  - There are different subjects, not \njust one realty, there are different subjects.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut now you have automation with Zoom and with already prepared links for download.\n  - So probably it makes sense \nto use existing links without waiting for me to host the same video somewhere else.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo your homework, if you do it well, no need to do it again for the next exam, yes you can take it again.\n  - Thank you \nBasic for your question.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOur session is over.\n  - Thank you and goodbye.\n\nKey Concepts: server, database, sql, data, package",
