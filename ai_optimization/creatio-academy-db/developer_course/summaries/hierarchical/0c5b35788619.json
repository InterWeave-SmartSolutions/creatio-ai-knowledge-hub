# Speaker 1\n\nDeveloping different features and functionality that.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nRequires some programming on Creature platform.\n  - And previously we finished with building our.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOwn section named Realty and we managed.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nTo set up List View, we managed to make a form page for it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe also added some default values and.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWe made some required fields and it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWas pretty much easy and we used.\n  - --- Page 2 ---\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOnly no code customization tools for this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAlso we managed to make a button.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWhich had a custom handler.\n  - So we made a button push me button and this custom handler shows some console \noutput.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nKind of JavaScript code behind this button.\n  - Today I will show you a bit.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nMore complicated examples of how you can.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDo some programming and coding and also we will discuss debugging.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo you will see how it's possible.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo stop execution of your code and.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\nMake it executed line by line.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBy line and to see all the.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nVariables and to see all the conditions.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo so to make something that you probably get used to do when you operate with any like modern version, modern.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nDevelopment environment like Visual Studio or other so today question today's session I would.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLike to warm up with Simple Question.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWhich is about organizing of your sections.\n  - It's probably not so obvious so I will tell you all apps it's like.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSynthetic Workplace which includes all registered sections in one list.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWe have Studio out of the box workplace, we have customer360 because it's a.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nResult of loaded contacts and accounts.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo our loaded customer360 app also caused creation of new workplace.\n  - Such workplaces also can be created, you \ncan manage them and you can put your sections into it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThat will be very easy, but I.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nNeed to demonstrate it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo show how you can do this.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nGo to Settings then find Workplace Setup.\n  - Workplace Setup helps us to create new workplace or to manage existing \nworkplaces.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nRun system under administrator privilege.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo now you can see I see only four workplaces.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nBut in total it looks like we.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nHave at least 5.\n  - And productivity workplace seems to not showing anything and not having any permission settings.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo that's probably why we are not seeing it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, let's go to studio workplace.\n  - We have set of sections for a workplace.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLet me show you columns set up for sections list.\n  - We can arrange and add the position column.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nNow you will understand why I display this position.\n  - Any section in a workplace has its position and position \norganizes order.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSometimes this order is not so consistent.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nYou see UI management and message templates, they have the same position.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nAnd sometimes UI management will be on top.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSometimes message templates will be on top depending on how data will be loaded at a certain time.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBecause sorting by this position it makes some ambitious result.\n  - Okay, so what I plan to do.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI plan to add one more section in the list system will show me only sections that are not listed here.\n  - And it's \ninteresting to see here that we have couple of accounts section.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt's very unusual.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCouple of calls and couple of contacts.\n  - One of the possible explanation why we.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHave two different account section is that.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOne of them is section for Classic.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nUi, another is Freedom UI section.\n  - We can also display columns here which.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nWill let you understand what we are looking at.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo we can just squeeze a bit title display e.g.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCreated on column save column settings.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow when we try to add you.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWill see title, you will see created on and one of them is 19, another is 24.\n  - And it looks like first one is.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nClassic UI, second one which is younger.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThis is freedom UI.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo that's how you can detect which one is necessary for you to add.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIn my case, I plan to find realty section created recently and we can see it at the end of this list.\n  - You see, its position \nis also not so consistent.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut it guarantees that it will be at the end.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nBut it's not so comfortable to see this item at the very end of this list.\n  - So possibly we would like to move it upper.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo let's go to do this.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nYou can move it even on the first top position.\n  - Unfortunately we cannot move it upper than home.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt if you want and realty will be position zero.\n  - So when we save it we can.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAlso reward this page.\n  - Probably we will see our reality section directly at Studio Workplace at zero position.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTheir position because reality shifted them.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo if we want to transport such change, we must make a corresponding data item.\n  - Or we can use help of data \nbinding tool.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\nWe can just click Bind Workplace, specify.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nTarget package and click save.\n  - Then we can see what was created.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd when we for example try to.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nActualize data and save it, we will see warning and this warning will tell.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nUs that such Studio Workplace was already.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nRegistered somewhere in parent package.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd even more it was registered one more time in another parent package.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nBut it's not a big mistake.\n  - So it's not a mistake at all.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSuch data is already present somewhere in parent packages data items.\n  - So maybe we are doing it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nIt'S not a mistake.\n  - Another one is sys module in Workplace.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo you can see data and you can see all the sections in Workplace.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nStudio were listed here.\n  - And also it's important to mention that forced update option must be applied for.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nPosition column because otherwise update or position.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWill be not performed.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou probably remember from our Tuesday session that when you create data items, it's.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nPossible that you will make data item that will perform update, not an insert.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIn case of update in case of.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nTarget record was found.\n  - --- Page 11 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBy the way, I prefer to make.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIt not by this key.\n  - I prefer to make it by this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nKey and found by id.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo if record was found by ID.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd then it will update target database according to loaded data and in our case only position will be updated.\n  - Okay, \nwe can save it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nNow you can see that save was.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSuccessful, but we have a lot of warnings related to parent data that was already registered in base product.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd this is valid set of warnings.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBecause our change caused the change of.\n  - --- Page 12 ---\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nPosition of all previously registered sections in Studio Workplace.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo simply all of the registered sections had different position because we moved our reality to the top and we.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nHad a warning that tells us that you're trying to Change the data which was originally declared somewhere else.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo maybe you're doing it wrong.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo please take care.\n  - Here is your warning.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut this warning is still so we can ignore this.\n  - And last one is admin unit in workplace.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThis is about access permissions.\n  - System administrators have full access to Studio.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWorkplace and probably this data is also.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nPresent in our database.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYes, so maybe not so necessary to save it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo it's warning, not an error in case if you have an error.\n  - For example, you save the same data twice in the same \npackage.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIn this case, save button will show you error message and save button will not disappear.\n  - If save button was \ndisappeared, means your.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nData item was normally saved.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf save button did not disappear, it means an error.\n  - It's like serious mistake and the system.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWill not allow you to save such data.\n  - It happens only when you save the.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSame data twice in the same package.\n  - Okay, so it was set of client modules of sorry, set of data items.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAutomatically created by help of data binding tool.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\nWhen we registered our reality section in a studio workplace, now we have comfort.\n  - Here is our new created section.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nHere is set of processes we will manage very soon.\n  - Here we have lookups which we also often look at.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd we'll use it and some other.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSystem sections that we may need.\n  - So we now have very comfortable conditions.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd easy transitions between different sections.\n  - So it was just a simple example how you can organize your \nworkplaces in.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nMore complicated based products like sales, service and marketing.\n  - You will see more workplaces, more sections \ninside.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nUsers with particular roles.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd you can provide permissions for such.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSections and for such workplaces.\n  - --- Page 15 ---\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd what is important for you to understand that you can create many different.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWorkplaces and include the same section many times.\n  - So if you added some section to.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSome workplace, it doesn't mean that you can't do it with another workplace.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo one context section can be added.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIn different places with no limitations.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIn my case, I have my applications.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWorkplace with real T section and I also have.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nJust a second.\n  - So what I wanted to show you.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nWe can use the same section in.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDifferent workplaces and it's not a problem.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIf we specify the same section in different workplaces many times.\n  - So physically this is the same section.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThe same data shown in different places.\n  - Just a second.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI think will be interesting for you to know.\n  - So let's do something more serious.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou can do some more serious programming.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nInside of Creature client side page using.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSome JavaScript and using creature tools and let's say data platform.\n  - First of all I will explain you some business \nideas.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo what we plan to do, my plan is to show you some recalculations and it could be a good example.\n  - --- Page 17 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf we for example create one more column, call it commission.\n  - So it will be our future profit from the deal.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd also we have to take care.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAbout the type offer.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo for sale we have one formula.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd for rental we will have another formula.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, let's do it step by step.\n  - So first of all we need new column.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNew column can be added to this very easily.\n  - We can just go to modify our page.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCarefully dropping it here it will be named Commission.\n  - And as we have a price in.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\nUS dollars, so let it be a commission.\n  - Also in the same currency, the inner.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nColumn name will be USR Commission.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd we confirm such code for this column.\n  - The data format will be decimal with two digits.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, great.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDecimal with two digits.\n  - And we want to make this commission calculated automatically so we don't allow users.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nTo manually change it.\n  - That's why I will set read only.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOption on I temporary hide place attachments tab.\n  - So my commission will be read only.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd also just to make it easier.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo find in div array, I will name its element code so we can type it as we wish Commission USD.\n  - Let it be our element \ncode.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nThis element code will be used in view config, div and also physically it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWill be used for building real page.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nHTML markup with set of divs inside.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd this code will be used to name set of items and div.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nHTML tags inside of our page.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo element code, it's about physical component.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nRepresentation on the page.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, you already know this and that's all I can just save System will.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAutomatically modify our object.\n  - --- Page 20 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt will save changes to our page code which we can find here if.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWe click open source code.\n  - So now let's just click save and.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThat'S probably will be enough for the beginning.\n  - So this change will be made in objects and in our client module.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, we can move on.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd now we can close this page editor.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nGo to main page.\n  - As you can see, I did not even reload it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe can just open it again and.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nProbably we will immediately see our new column and it's read only.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo you see this lock sign which.\n  - --- Page 21 ---\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nTells us that column is read only.\n  - So now we need to think of.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nImplementing read calculation and it will be.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nTriggered by change of price.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd also we want to make it dependent on offer type.\n  - So for the sales offer type it will be more or less okay if we \nmake commission like 2% from list price from our price of realty shown here.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nI'm not sure that can we find.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo cheap houses in Miami for maybe it's not like not in a high season and some area.\n  - And as you can see, \ncommission will be recalculated.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo for rentals probably it will be.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nQuite enough if we will ask for 50% from monthly payment price if this is a rental.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n\nSo for rentals we will have another percentage.\n  - So for sales it will be 1% or 2% value.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd for rental it will be 50% from price value.\n  - So when we will do some calculation we have to take care about it.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nBut also you should be mentally ready.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThat in real life business it really often happens that such ratios, such formulas can be changed from time to time.\n  - And once we introduce hard coded value like 2% a month later our customer may call us and say, you know.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNow conditions were changed so we need to modify this percent and now it will be 2.5.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nCould you please change it?\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd if we hard code it, of course it's not so good idea to.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nGo into code and change it.\n  - Then deliver changes to production.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\nTo make such changes.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd our customer will be not ready will be not really happy if we ask for example for half, maybe for a couple of \nhours of work to be paid.\n  - If we want to change just one number.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWe have several options to do this.\n  - For example, we can make a separate.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTable which will keep necessary percents.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOr we can use some system settings for this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOr as you can see, our ratio is really stick to offer type.\n  - So probably we can add new column to offer type lookup in \norder to save one value in percent for sales.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd another value in percent for rentals.\n  - I will show you how we can do this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLet's focus on objects Again, now we.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nHave offer type object, we can open it for edit.\n  - I prefer to work from configuration section.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIn this case you can do the same if you.\n  - Oh, I did not save it.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nGreat.\n  - So if you prefer to focus on.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nApplication, you can go to Application hub.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nYou may find your realty app, you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nMight check your data models and that's.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nHow you can find corresponding object.\n  - Or you can switch to advanced settings.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo see all the contents of your solution.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo you may practically do almost the.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSame as you can do it here.\n  - So I just get used to work.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWith this configuration section.\n  - Also it has some useful actions like.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSave packages to file system.\n  - So that's why I stick to this.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nApproach and I feel more confident when.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWork here because I have full available.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSet of tools to manage my system set my system configuration setup.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo we opened corresponding object, we have.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nInheritance from base lookup and that's why we have eight inherited columns and we did not add any other own \ncolumns so far.\n  - So for each reality offer type for rental or sale, we can add one.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nMore column to be number.\n  - Maybe we can do it with quite high precision.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n\nHere just to make it clear for.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAny user what type of value should be put here.\n  - So if we specify from 0 to 100 it means from 0 to 100% and it will be \nclear how to.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nPut some value here if you want.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nTo save for example 2%.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOne more column is not a big deal, so we can easily add it save and publish.\n  - But after we do this we may start to get \nsome additional unexpected difficulties.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNow I will show it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nProbably sometimes I get it, sometimes not.\n  - But anyway I have to tell you about this.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo we added new column to some.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nObject that was already present for today morning.\n  - --- Page 27 ---\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo it was already created recently.\n  - That's why we can face some unexpected behavior.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n  - Now you can see it's very close and easy to switch between our section and \nfor example lookups.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNow we have name and description.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, let's try to set up columns to display.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nName is okay here description is also.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay and we can try to display one more column.\n  - Commission percent looks good and we can save it.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd we agreed that for a sale it will be enough for us to specify 2%.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAccording to this helpful message, 2% will look like this 2.00, so it means just 2.\n  - And for rentals we expect to earn \n50% but from monthly payment.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n\nWe added some data.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo possibly we have to look at data part and find corresponding object reality offer type object so not object data \nitem for this.\n  - Let me find it.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIt looks like it was created by data binding tool, so we could also.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNo, no.\n  - This is lookup registering.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo now we have one more column here.\n  - We can update this data item with.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThe help of data binding tool.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOr we can manually modify it by adding one more column.\n  - As you can see, originally this column was not present \nhere because we created.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nData item before adding new columns to the object.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\nSo now we have one more column.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHere we have new data.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n2% for sale, 50% for rental.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe have to save it.\n  - Everything is okay.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nGreat.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt looks like we still did not need to do any additional steps related to adding new column into existing object.\n  - But \nsome of you may start to feel some difficulties and such difficulties are.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nConnected with the way how server side system remembers information about objects.\n  - And unfortunately it may \nhappen that your.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nKind of difficulty which you will finally face will be inability to display data here or inability to use new column a bit \nlater.\n  - In order to fix this, you may need maintenance tools for creation so which we already installed.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nI will do this restart but a bit later.\n  - --- Page 30 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow I will try to avoid this to show you what will happen if you did not perform a restart.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo let's check will we be able.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo make all the way all the settings as I plan to do this and will we need restart or not?\n  - So let's go.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nData and for rental value we also.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHave another additional data.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd it's really lucky for us.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThat it's possible to get such additional data out from this lookup somewhere at the top where we can easily use \nsuch data columns.\n  - Now I plan to show you how to get data out from a lookup.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWe will use again page editor.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n\nOur task is to get decimal value from this offer type lookup and display it somewhere.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nThe reason why we need to display.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIs to make it visual and also to make it fully no code.\n  - So now you will see this trick how we can make data out from \nexisting lookup.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nCall data fields and data fields represents.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nConnection between controls and real life data column of your main object that this page works with.\n  - But if you \nscroll down you will.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nFind interesting set of components called inputs.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nInputs are designed to organize input only without direct connection with your main data object and without direct \nsave of any data that you input into this call.\n  - Simply speaking, inputs are controls that you use for inputs but not \nintended to save data from them or at least.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNot save into main primary object with the standard tools.\n  - So maybe you will save it somewhere somehow else.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLet me show you how I can use this for our task.\n  - I need number control.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nCan take out from existing lookups or.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nExisting from existing fields.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nLet me show you how we can do this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe go to data source, click on this lookup button and then we will search.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo select some data field that we will use to fill this control.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nRealty related objects.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIt will show us all existing lookup.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nColumns in our realty object and then we will find offer type extended and system will show us only suitable on the \ncompatible field which will be you can be used within decimal number control.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 33 ---\n\nThis is our commission percent so we.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWill select it and here now you will see some changes.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nTitle appeared the same as title of your column inside of your offer type.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLookup Code appeared and cannot be edited.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nThis is read only and also you can unlock it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo this column will be constantly read only.\n  - Title position okay title on the page.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd element code number input.\n  - So we can call it something like.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nCommission percent okay and save change of our element code.\n  - So simply speaking we made read only column \nthat will be automatically loaded each.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nTime offer type is set and each.\n  - --- Page 34 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTime offer type changed or cleared.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nLet's save our changes and we will.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSee how it works.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nBy the way, please confirm with plus in our chat if you follow me.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDirectly during the session.\n  - So I need to know, should I.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAllow you some pause to do some steps after I demonstrate it?\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nMarcel, thank you, Andre.\n  - Thank you.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIf something is not good and you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWould like me to stop for a while, tell me please.\n  - Okay, Monica, thank you again.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nGreat.\n  - So we saved our page.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThen we can go to our page.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nClose, open it again.\n  - Now you see this commission percentage shown.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nJust to suppress any possible issue with the browser cache.\n  - So let's open again.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nBut you see this commission percent is not shown.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, let's try to select another one.\n  - Rental or I chose sale again.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nClose.\n  - Such data will be not possible to see in list.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo we have no reality column which will represent our commission percent.\n  - We can read it from the database.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 36 ---\n\nIf we use related objects, if we.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nUse offer type and if we display.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nCommission percent and this commission percent will.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBe obtained from corresponding record from our offer type.\n  - But you see, now we have some troubles.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWe have some troubles and system does.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNot recognize commission percent column fully.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nProbably it also shows us some error messages, I believe.\n  - Let's try to reload it and see what happens.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNo, no error message.\n  - It just doesn't show us corresponding values.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWe can find columns there.\n  - So our commission percent is here.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n\nSo what is happening and why we have such a trouble?\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd if you open the page, you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSee no initial value here.\n  - But if you click there and back.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nTo sale now you see this value.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIs okay, save, close, open and still it doesn't work.\n  - So we still have some problem with this additional column.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nBy logging out and logging in.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo let me show you.\n  - I try to log out.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nMaybe thinking.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThere is something like a user session cache issue.\n  - Then I try to log in.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWhen you work with client side, it's.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBetter to keep your browser console on.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nProbably you will see some interesting messages.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThere or a lot of red messages.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIn case of errors.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it's important to see it quick.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, opening our realty section, ignoring all.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWarnings here, open it once again and you see no, it did not help us.\n  - So unfortunately logging out and logging in.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n\nDoesn'T help you and the only solution.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWhich we can do is restart our app or shut it down and start it again for example with the help of IIS Manager.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nBut it will take more than minute.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFor us to normally shut down and start.\n  - So we have a quick solution.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nErrors in browser console, but it looks.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLike not very critical.\n  - So now restart is being performed.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nProcess, but it has a comment to.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nRestart so possibly to rewards some of its assemblies.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, so we restarted our app.\n  - --- Page 40 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe go to reality section.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nNow we already will see the difference.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow you see that commission percent here.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWas normally displayed in this list previously it was not normal.\n  - And if we open any record now, commission percent \nwill be fully normally loaded.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWhen we just open the page.\n  - So you see commission percent loaded correctly if you take any other value.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo now we fixed it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd that's why I had to use this add on called maintenance tools for creature.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSuch add on helps me easily restart.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThe app with just waiting approximately 10 seconds.\n  - And it's much easier than restarting my.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nApp by shutting down and starting again my worker process or recycling worker process.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt's possible, so it will take significantly longer.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, so we fixed this question with.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThe commission percent and now our task.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIs.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo make actual calculation.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo now we can think of how.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo trace changes of price or commission percent.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 42 ---\n\nLuckily commission percent will be available for.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nUs the same as any attribute for a real column.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo commission percent will be also an attribute for us.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo if this value changes or if.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThis value changes, as you can see, it will be changed in case if.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou clear in case if you set.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSome offer type or if you change.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nTo another offer type, commission percent is changed.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo price or commission percent should trigger recalculation of commission.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n\nI will show you how we can do this.\n  - Let's go to our configuration section.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFind client modules.\n  - We are working with form page.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo you can also open the code.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFrom page editor if you want.\n  - I just feel it's more comfortable to work here.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo form page open source code.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThat's how we can go directly to the JavaScript part of it and See what's happening.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAndrean is asking is it possible to use this add on in a cloud environment?\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYes, all creation apps from Marketplace can.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nBe installed on cloud systems.\n  - Absolutely the same as you can install it locally.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLet me show you.\n  - So you go to Settings, you go.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nTo Application management, Application Hub and then.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou click Install or Add new application and you can select something from this list or you can select Marketplace \nPowered.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd it will work absolutely the same.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf you run it in cloud.\n  - Thank you Adrian for your interesting question.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWe decided to open directly its source code.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThat's how we open this tab.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWe can try to find our commission diff part.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou can see this our commission column.\n  - It was added by help of page editor.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo practically we should not modify this.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nBut it will be interesting to see how it will be connected with the.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nData attribute PDS USR commission USR so.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThis is our attribute name.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, we can collapse temporary all such things.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI will only show you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo price.\n  - Okay, we need price, we need commission so we can collapse all other new config div items till we will face \nview model config.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSet of variables that can be saved.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 46 ---\n\nOn the page level.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd we already started to work with.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt yesterday I just tried to explain you such attributes and now we will work with them.\n  - So for the price column we \nsee this attribute name.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd for the percent here we have this attribute name and finally we will save our data into commission attribute \nwhich has this name.\n  - This is important.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, I will collapse anything else to make it clear and quite compact for you.\n  - So we are interested in price attribute.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nPercent attribute and commission attribute.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay?\n  - Nothing else.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nModel config is not interesting.\n  - And then we will do something with handlers.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nI already have an example which will make it possible for us to do it quickly.\n  - So let me show you this example of the \ncode examples reading UI and then we need calculated field example.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nProbably we need to look at Academy.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo explain all possible handler names.\n  - So let's go to Academy, let's go to guides development front end Freedom UI \nand somewhere we will see some client schema references handlers.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNames for handlers and they represent some.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nImportant steps of page life cycle.\n  - In our case, we are interested in the handler which is triggered each time when \nsome data, some attribute data changed.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAt our page changes the attribute.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo this handler is called handle view model attribute change request.\n  - Let me show you my example.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nHandle view model attribute change request.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo simply speaking, this handler will be called each time when any column value changes at our user at our client \nside page in our browser.\n  - So this handler will be triggered quite often.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nCopy it and put it to our.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nExamples in our handlers area.\n  - So this is an array, we have.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nTo keep syntax well.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd that's why I try to paste it like this, keeping commas, brackets and so on.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo now you see, this piece of.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nCode was just simply added.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThis piece of code was added and.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLet'S check what we can do with it.\n  - Of course we have to take care about attribute names because they are always \nunique.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 49 ---\n\nSo how we can check it?\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThis handler will be called quite often for each column change.\n  - And in order to make it efficient, we need to check if \nsome column.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThat we are interested had changed or not.\n  - If yes, then we do our recalculation.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf not, we should do nothing in.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOrder to save system resources.\n  - So we check request property here and.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe have attribute name.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd if this attribute name is our.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nPrice, then this is logical or attribute name is our commission percent.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThen we do some calculation, but we.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 50 ---\n\nHave to actualize our names so you.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCan see our list of attributes for the price.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHere is our attribute name.\n  - Let's copy it and carefully paste here.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nTo read it, then the same for commission percent.\n  - Let's make sure this is our attribute name.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLet me show you.\n  - Yes, it looks like it is already.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThe same because generated by system and.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nI usually do same examples.\n  - That's a bit strange shifts.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo how we do this?\n  - I already showed you yesterday.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe have to use operator await.\n  - Then request is our argument dollar context and then we have access to our certain \nattribute.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo we have just a variable in.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOur JavaScript code for price for percent.\n  - Then we do calculation of commission as result of multiplication and don't \nForget to.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nDivide by 100 because commission percent represents.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nPercent, not just a decimal value.\n  - Okay, and then we will save our commission percent.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIf we do it incorrectly, we will fail.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo this is important.\n  - Our commission value will be finally saved into this.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nProbably it's because of cache.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo let's reload the page.\n  - Reloading helps to fight with browser cache effect.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 52 ---\n\nNow you can see that recalculation works well.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo we have our price for rental of our apartment.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd you see our commission is correctly.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nRecalculated and we can save our data.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCommission will be also saved.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe can see it here.\n  - Commission is our legal valid column, so it will be saved.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nLet's open some sale example.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow you can see.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, price was not changed.\n  - --- Page 53 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nCommission is already calculated.\n  - Let's check if we switch from sale to rental.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nYou see, commission was recalculated.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf we switch back to sale, it's.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAlso quite well calculated.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo now you see that our commission is quite fair for this amount of price for the house.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo our recalculation also works well and it shows even when page is opened.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt looks like when page is opened our data filled in client side.\n  - So it triggers recalculation even if we.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nDo not change anything.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut just open the page.\n  - Yes, we'll see.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo it looks like our calculation is.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAlready done and works quite well.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd of course everything works quite smoothly.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWhen we have a pre programmed examples where everything is correct.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nBut in real life you will do.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYour own examples where some errors or mistakes could happen.\n  - So you will need to know how to debug this code.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI will show you how to make.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSuch debug and you will see that's not so difficult.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 55 ---\n\nOne of the easiest ways to debug is to put a special debugger breakpoint into your code.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLike this, the word debugger.\n  - If you provide such debugger statement, it means that you ask for debug session and \nyou stop execution of your JavaScript code.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThen your debugging will work for you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut this approach has also disadvantage.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd when you finished your debugging, you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nShould not forget to remove all your debugger lines.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSave your changes again.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd ideally you have to run your.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nLogic again just to make sure you did not accidentally damage anything.\n  - Because when you save, you have chance.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 56 ---\n\nThat something will be incorrectly saved.\n  - Something will go not so well.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI need to explain and I need to show you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe can go to this is easy.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWay to put debugger word.\n  - I will show you a bit more professional way to debug.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThen we enable browser developer console.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nYou can do it by F12 or control shift I.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd when you do this, you then.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nGo to Sources tab.\n  - You see, we already opened some set of scripts here.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLet's close everything and then we can.\n  - --- Page 57 ---\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nJust search and you see we have.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nA USR reality form page.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nPage part of the URL.\n  - So it's a page, it's a name of client module and we can try to find it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLet's try Control p open file.\n  - Which one?\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, if you do not want to.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nGuess which one is correct, we can go back reload the page.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo we will suppress any kind of.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nCache and then we will open it again.\n  - And we have just one option, single option to select corresponding file Control \nP .\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 58 ---\n\nAnd you see only one form page here.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo no any cached, no any duplicates that will make you confused.\n  - And you probably may select Incorrect 1.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSee set of equalizable strings here.\n  - But the most important of course is our code.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBig part with view config div some.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nPart view model config.\n  - And finally you will have your header handlers.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFor example, we can click on this.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nLine number which will make a breakpoint for us.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it's the same as debugger, but.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIt doesn't change the source of our client module.\n  - --- Page 59 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo we can use browser debugging tools for this.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nClick on the line number.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThat's how we activate breakpoint.\n  - So here we have one breakpoint that we just clicked here.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOn and execution comes to this line, execution will be stopped.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nLet me show you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf you change for example offer type from rental to sale, you see these.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nLines are executed and now code stops and we can go line by line.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow we have to use tools that.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 60 ---\n\nWill help us to proceed with this piece.\n  - The most popular, I think the Most.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nEfficient is F10 which is a step over running of a line without going into sub functions for it.\n  - So I will press F10.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThen you can see commission was recalculated.\n  - Now you will see commission will be set here.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo my commission is now 26, so.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI expect it to be saved here.\n  - Yes, 26 and then we move on.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo here we can use resume F8 hotkey to normally continue execution.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThat's how we can check this code.\n  - If we change the price.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou will see the Same I press F10 I.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nHave another commission F8.\n  - Okay, we can make more serious price.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFor an apartment.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd obviously we'll have more serious commission.\n  - So that's how you can debug your code.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAlso, if your code has something has some obvious mistakes and causes runtime errors.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nYou will also see such runtime errors in your sources tab.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou will also see your console which.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWill be full of red messages.\n  - So in case if your code fails.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIn runtime of course you should take care about it and look at your console tab and check if everything works well or \nnot.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWhen you finished your debugging you should.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nClick on wine number again removing your breakpoint and then your code will run without stops.\n  - --- Page 62 ---\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIt's interesting to see what value we will see in case if we will clear overtype.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow let's check.\n  - You see that percent is empty so percent is null.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo that's how we will clear.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, when we have some valid percent, we can move on with F8 and you see setting is done.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIf you have any questions related to.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThis debugging, please tell me.\n  - As you can see, debugging can be.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nReally effective if your code is more.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nComplex, if you have sub functions, if.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 63 ---\n\nYou are not sure what values you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFinally get from your code so you can check it out with the help of browser developer tools.\n  - Okay, probably we got an \nhour of.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOur session, so let's make a few.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFive minutes break and then move on.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWith next topics related to programming.\n  - I also plan to show you some.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nExamples of programming of validation.\n  - So I plan to show you validation and.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nDifferent validators.\n  - So different clones will be used for universal validation.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd also I plan to show you some examples of so we already displayed.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nDebugging but also you need to know a bit more about logging.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 64 ---\n\nOkay, so let's make a five minutes break foreign.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo today I want you to see.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSome more technical things about how client.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSide works and how we can do.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSome technical steps with it.\n  - So we already know how to debug our code.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nI would also like to you to see that we have quite developed logging.\n  - So I will show you login mechanisms.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nThat are available on Creature Platform.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHere is our installed app and this is our folder with installed application.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWe go to terrasoftware web and you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 65 ---\n\nAlready know that Creature uses analog libraries to provide the different logs and save them in Creature web server.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nThe most important log file for us.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIs invoke targets config because here we can change default file to save our all default folder to save all our logs.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nYou may be interested in the way.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHow we can do some logging.\n  - So we have so called appenders and.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nTargets and probably have to start from appender first.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo analog config I should use analog config first.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd we have a lot of loggers.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAs well appender so they are synonym.\n  - Logger or appender they are synonyms.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo you can see a lot of.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDifferent loggers registered and appenders are settings that will collect log messages.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd finally appenders will be connected with physical files.\n  - So you see we have more than.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n100 different loggers and logger is a logical thing that you can use in your program code.\n  - Appender is a place that is \nused to collect your data and save it.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOf different logs that are saved here.\n  - And you can see different messages, different settings.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo Croatia has a lot of default.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nTypes of logs and all of them will be saved in a folder which.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe specify when we install our application.\n  - So in Analog Targets config line number three we have setting to save \nour logs to.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd log folder which.\n  - Which.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt has no customizable items that will.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nBe interested for us to.\n  - Interesting for us to see.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo Loader is very technical and we have just several log files here, nothing very spectacular.\n  - And zero folder is what \nwe really need because it's a log set of.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nLogs for our main application.\n  - And then we go inside, we see.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLogs for each separate date.\n  - So you see for different days you.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nHave logs in different folder which makes it easy to find.\n  - And then you see different logs here.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDifferent files with logs saved here.\n  - So a lot of different logs, a lot of different files.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 68 ---\n\nAnd what is the most important for.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou from the maintenance point of view?\n  - I think the most important is error log.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOf course you should take care about.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt because usually it is important and sometimes you may find some errors which are not related to your changes.\n  - So you may simply speaking find some errors from base product like this one.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nError parent schema is now parent ID.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSets to empty and so on.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nBut it looks like nothing very critical for our application.\n  - You see the same error many times.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd it looks like not very important.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nBut if you will get some error messages here related to your functionality and your users will start to complain about.\n  - --- Page 69 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSomething is not working.\n  - Of course you cannot ignore this.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nYou may ask me why we have.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSome errors in a wait production release software.\n  - The answer is that Croatia is quite big and we have more than \n200 libraries.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nCould be checked and used.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it's really hard to test everything and to polish any line of code, so it should show it so it could not fail in any way.\n  - So in real life, in any big system, some errors usually happen.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nCritical so you can simply ignore.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut if you will find another errors with some user complaints, of course you should take care of it.\n  - So from \nmaintenance point of view, I think looking at such error log is quite important.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nDo regularly if you support some big creation implementation by your own.\n  - In cloud conditions, looking at such logs.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 70 ---\n\nIs complicated because you will not be.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAble to directly go to cloud based file system to get it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo you only can ask for help at support team.\n  - By the way, you should know Support team lives here support \ncreation.com so they work 24, 7.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd if you ask for example for a yesterday logs for a searching website.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThey can give it for you.\n  - But it will be more efficient for.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nYou if you can collect Logs by yourself.\n  - And that's why I plan to show.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou some special tool which makes it.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nEasier if you need to collect logs.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFrom cloud based environment.\n  - So I will show you Now I'm.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 71 ---\n\nTalking about telemetry log for creation.\n  - This is a special add on which.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe can get from Application Hub New application Marketplace powered.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nThen we can just search for the.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWord log and we will easily find this Hokku app or telemetry log for creation.\n  - So Hoku is a company physically this \ncompany is like founded by our creation employees.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nYou can install this telemetry log.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThis is for free.\n  - Agree.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nConfirm.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou see it was just updated 2023 November.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOkay.\n  - And install it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt takes just almost no time, maybe 20 seconds.\n  - And you will see that new app.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIs installed to our system.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo you'll be able to collect vlogs, but you'll be able to collect only runtime created logs.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo it's like listener for logs.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou will not be able to collect.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nYesterday logs, but if you do some.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nExperiments and you need to see how logs look like when you do your experiments in cloud.\n  - So this app will be \nextremely helpful for you because it shows you all the messages all the log messages that.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAre saved on disk.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo you can listen to any logs saved on disk.\n  - --- Page 73 ---\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nLet's patiently wait for its installation.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSurprisingly it takes a bit longer than I expected.\n  - But it's okay now it's not so critical.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nMaybe we can look at browser developer.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nConsole here, but usually no trouble should be present.\n  - Okay, wait for a minute.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOh, dotnet exe was running so it looks like compilation was done.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo system decided it needs to compile and that's why it was so slow.\n  - Okay, finally our compilation finished.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOperation took so long to install.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo now you will see results.\n  - Okay, great.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 74 ---\n\nHere's our installation logs.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nStarted 26:58, so almost 27, finished 29.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIt looks like 2 minutes and 3.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSeconds and yeah, it's a bit longer than usual.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd 27:15, 28:56 so it looks like.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFull configuration compilation was performed.\n  - That's why it took so long and okay, no problem, we can live with it.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo now you will see one more app here in this list.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTelemetry and you can reload this tab.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNow you will see one more item at our settings page.\n  - --- Page 75 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nPreviously called System Designer.\n  - Currently it's called Settings.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo I will show you how you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nCan use this telemetry log here?\n  - Yes.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nLogs in order to get some error.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nMessages for the certain, let's say subject or certain area of functionality.\n  - And you can also listen everything like \nthis, which will mean that you look and get every message.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSQL.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOh, so it's called JSoft Core DB executor SQL log appender.\n  - Okay, will it be DB executor?\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd we're only interested in for example errors.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 76 ---\n\nSo I plan to make example of listening of DB execution errors.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd I especially will do some example which makes such an error.\n  - Let's go to customer360, find accounts and.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLet'S try to remove some account.\n  - Obviously we will not be able to do this because it has some connections with \nexisting contacts.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNow you see no messages here.\n  - Try to do this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHere I expect to get.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nI expect to get error messages.\n  - Oh, I should subscribe.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, let's try to delete once again.\n  - Yes, error message appears logger pattern.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIt was not an error, it was just a warning.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo like yellow color, which means this.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 77 ---\n\nIs not an error, just a warning.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd okay, so I got some text message from our DB executor and you.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSee that my message has an error.\n  - So exception occurred, statement terminated.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd you see that we get some.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nText messages and logs.\n  - You can also get the same logs.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf you go to your files, you.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWill find SQL JSON.\n  - Here we will have similar information.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo you see my delete statement failed, so it conflicted with foreign reference constraint.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd it's interesting that for the SQL.\n  - --- Page 78 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nErrors, system logs only queries that were failed.\n  - So only queries that failed to be.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nExecuted at the database.\n  - In my case, I intentionally made an.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nError for the database level and showed you how you can handle it and how you can track it.\n  - You can also use all \nexisting loggers for all messages subscribe.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nJust when you go to any part.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOf your system, when you open any.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSection, you will start to get more and more logs.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBecause system usually writes something to logs and it has quite verbose logging.\n  - So you will have more and more \ndata.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nYou have to play a bit with it.\n  - But finally you will be able to.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDo the same as you can do with log files.\n  - --- Page 79 ---\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo this telemetry log for creation will.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBe extremely helpful in case if you.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNeed to make some experiments and get.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLogs directly in online mode from your cloud environments, including even production systems.\n  - So this can be really \nhelpful for you.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAs you can see we have some help message explaining how to use this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSome button which shows or it runs and stops a listening of logs.\n  - So green means run, red means stopped and \nthat's how you can also use it.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo listening all of the logs will.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nProvide you a lot of verbose noisy messages.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 80 ---\n\nIt's up to you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo maybe this will be interesting for you.\n  - So just remember the name of the tool is Telemetry for Creatio.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nBefore we doing this I need to explain you how to do validation.\n  - As you can see my previous program.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWas a bit more oriented on classic ui.\n  - So sometimes I jump from topics topics and that's why we are not following \ndirectly from this schedule.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo let's move on validation.\n  - What it is about and this is.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nCheck of data before it will be.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSaved at server side.\n  - Let's return back to our reality section and let's look at our data value.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo when we add new values it may happen that user may save some very incorrect values.\n  - For example, we can try \nto save negative price.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 81 ---\n\nIt's also possible to save negative area and also system does not prevent us from doing such things.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo we can save it.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd as you can see from system.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nPoint of view there is no troubles, no errors.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nBut of course we have trouble from.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBusiness point of view because we can't.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNormally summarize values, we can't normally calculate commission.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo we have to make some kind of protection for our data input.\n  - And luckily we have this on the platform level as \nexisting validation tools.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWe also need to Program this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 82 ---\n\nUnfortunately validation is only available when you do programming, so it's not a no code setting.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nBut we are not afraid of this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLet's go to our configuration section, find our form page again, open its source code again.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd I need to show.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou some examples at our Academy documentation.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWhich will really help you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo we have some architectural SDK things.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAt front end documentation, but we have.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nA lot of useful examples in platform customization area of our academy.\n  - And we have examples for Freedom UI for \nfields examples and we have examples of population of fields.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd we have example of validation of.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nField which we are interested right now.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo I will share useful links for such articles.\n  - I recommend you to read it or just maybe look at it.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo let me explain how we plan to move on.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe have special area in our code named validators.\n  - Let me show you.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo we have handlers and we have validators.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it's a special designed place for.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nUs to program special functions that will.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 84 ---\n\nBe used for checks of data during input.\n  - And luckily we have examples at Academy.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWhich will help us to make it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSmoothly without spending too much time.\n  - So validators is a collection, this is not an array.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nNow you see, this is a collection.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nEach collection item should include its name.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd implementation and validation.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nImplementation includes validator property which is a.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFunction that finally should return something set of parameters and async property.\n  - Then when we finish with this \npart, we will connect our created validator with set of columns.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCan do this and I already have.\n  - --- Page 85 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAn example, we will not spend too.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nMuch time on it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo now you will see how we can do this validation.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nFirst of all we go to validators area and we will provide some code here.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nI already have example, no difficulties.\n  - So Freedom UI validation example and I need to provide this example of code.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, let me copy and paste for you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThis is example of our validation.\n  - Okay, no need to use cameras to show.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd I will also implement it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt's my own validators area.\n  - So copy and paste.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWhat do you see here?\n  - So we register my validator with a specific name.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo this is a kind of type or maybe validator type, let's call it so.\n  - And we can declare different numbers or unlimited \nnumber of different validators.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo probably we have to start with parameters first, because parameters are values that we can provide for each \nvalidated column.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd for different columns, we can provide different parameter values.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nHere we have to declare what parameters we will have.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIn my case there are two parameters.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nMin value and message parameter.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nValidator function has a bit complex structure.\n  - This is one function, it returns another.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 87 ---\n\nFunction and first function requests config, Another function requests control inside of control.\n  - Unfortunately we \nonly have value so it makes it difficult for us to analyze several values from different columns on our page.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nBut it makes it universal.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf we have value, we don't know exact column.\n  - So we can use the same validator for many different columns or \ndifferent columns and it will be universal for us.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThe config we know what parameters to expect.\n  - So we have min value parameter and we have message parameter.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOur check is quite simple.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWe get value and then compare with min value.\n  - And in case if our value is.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nGreater or equal than min value then.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWe think that data is correct and.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOur returned result will be null which.\n  - --- Page 88 ---\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nMeans no warnings, no messages, everything is okay.\n  - But in case that value is not.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nCorrect we have to return special type.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOf result which is a JavaScript object with a specific name, the property inside and with the message property inside \nof this property.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it's kind of nested JavaScript object.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd our message here will be text.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt should be displayed nearby problem control.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd also this message will be explained.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDisplayed when we will try to save our page.\n  - So we will say try to save data system will check all the validators and it \nwill find that some columns.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 89 ---\n\nAre not correct and it will not.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAllow to save it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo this is our example of a.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nValidation, but it's not applied yet.\n  - So we have to set up some.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nColumns which will work with this validator.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOtherwise our validator is useless because no.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nColumn expect checks with it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo I do not need to change anything here.\n  - This code is universal as you can see.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOnly one hard coded thing is a validator type name.\n  - Next step is connection of validator with.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCertain columns or it's better to say with attributes.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo I will show you examples.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nHow we can connect.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nMaybe I should do it here.\n  - How we can connect validators to columns.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAfter module config I have to provide.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nValidators setting so I should carefully copy.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThis.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd paste it here.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 91 ---\n\nAnd that's.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHow I will put it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo here's my price attribute.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHere is my validator.\n  - The type of validator should be matched.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWith what we created and parameter.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo the minimum value for the price.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI think it will be 50.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo we will not allow to save.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAny reality object with the price less than 50 bucks.\n  - --- Page 92 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, and also we can use message, not just a plain string constant which.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIs also supported, but also we can use localizable string.\n  - Here is an example of a macro that you can use for \nlocalizable strings.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo let me show you what localizable strings I plan to use.\n  - I will put it for you.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI go to localizable strings.\n  - Probably we can save it before modifications.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut now I will modify non localizable.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nStrings.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTake significantly longer than usual.\n  - As you can see, my worker process consumed quite a lot of ram.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, we can try to create localizable.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 93 ---\n\nString with the code price can't be less and the value is price cannot be less than something.\n  - Okay, try to add and \nthen I expect some troubles here.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThat's why I will try to save now.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf it saves correctly, okay, no problem.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nBut in previous versions I experienced some.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTroubles with localizable strings here and it turned out to save it.\n  - So when I added once, it physically.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAdded it twice and then denied to.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSave because it tells that such localizable string already exists.\n  - In case, if you face this kind.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOf issue when you add localizable string.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTry to save and then get error message about duplicated localizable strings.\n  - You can just remove that visible one \nthat you created.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 94 ---\n\nAnother one which is invisible will be still saved.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo that's how you can bypass this bug.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAs you can see, Creature also as.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAny software, it has its own bugs.\n  - Sometimes bugs are detected, fixed new bugs appeared.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo it's normal, more or less normal for any software.\n  - Another localizable string that we will need is about area.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nValue here, save it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nArea can't be less.\n  - Let's try to save.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd my intention when I save each time I add the localizable string is to check do I have any bugs with localizable \nstring.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIt looks like in this version this bug was finally fixed.\n  - --- Page 95 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThat's nice.\n  - So for the price we already set.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSettings, now we do the same for area.\n  - So let me show you what we.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDo for area we will set validators setting for one column.\n  - We can use multiple validators so it's possible to make \nchecks with different criterias.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd in my case for the area.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nI will use the same validator but.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nMinimum value will be 100 square feet.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it's close to 10 square meters.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWe think that we will not input.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAny kind of realty less than 10.\n  - --- Page 96 ---\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSquare meters or 100 square feet.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd that's our limitation here.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd we will use localizable string that.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe already successfully saved.\n  - Okay, now we have this example, save.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIt and then it's our turn to.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTest and check out how our data were saved.\n  - How well it looks, we can close.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOur editor, go to main app probably.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nLet'S reward it just to fight with.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 97 ---\n\nAny potential impact of browser cache issue.\n  - Then let's open any record and specially intentionally open the record \nwhich has incorrect stuff here.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nNow you see that once we finished.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd moved focus out of control, you see we have some checks and this checks displays error message.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nPrice can't be less than 50 bucks.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nArea can't be less than 100 square feet.\n  - If we try to save such data, system will reject it tells us we.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nHave problems and we have to fix them.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, let's fix only price try to save.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWe still have trouble with area.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWhen we fix area then our troubles are over and system saves it normally.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 98 ---\n\nPlease note that if you do something.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLike this and try to save your.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nData Validation works at client side so it doesn't send any messages to server side.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow you see nothing appeared in network tab until we will fully fix our rental price.\n  - In this case you see update query \nexecuted.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSide only in case of successful client validation.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo this validation may help you to improve your logic to make it more protected to get rid of like silly.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nMistakes made by end users.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd I think that this is something that will be quite important in your future projects and implementation.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nNow I plan to show you some.\n  - --- Page 99 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSimple topic and it's simple but it's very important because such topic will be.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nQuite often faced in your projects.\n  - It will be not really directly connected with programming, but it's something that \nyou definitely should know about.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nI'm talking about typical settings of columns.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThat you need according to some conditions.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFor example, some column must be visible.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOnly in case of a certain condition and otherwise should be hidden or another.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nColumn must be required according to some conditions and otherwise should be optional.\n  - And also you may need \nsome like talk about visibility, about required settings, or about read only columns.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo such typical Settings for columns are.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFrequently faced in requirements from business owners.\n  - --- Page 100 ---\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd that's why such functionality was decided to implement as a no code Tools.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd developers code such functionality.\n  - Business rules Let me show you how you can manage such business rules \nand I will show you a couple of examples.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nPage business rules mainly used for controls.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nVisibility, maybe required property, read only property and also we have object business rules.\n  - Here it's called realty \nbusiness rules but.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nYou should understand this is about object.\n  - Object business rules also offer us possibility.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo make some filtering and depending on the type of business row, it will be physically saved into metadata of a.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nPage or into metadata of an object.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo let me show you.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 101 ---\n\nLet's imagine our task is quite simple.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo show comment only in case of type is not empty.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo when we add new data, type.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nCould be not specified.\n  - In this case, comment should be hidden.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWe can use page level business rules.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBecause it's about column visibility add new rule.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThis rule will have automatically generated title.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo be applied to the page and it has triggering condition, page is open or some condition changed.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo we have if scenario and then action.\n  - Okay, let's start with if and now we will think of something like.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nI should do it a bit better with initial status.\n  - Okay, so if our type is not empty, then comment should be visible.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nLet's try to do this attribute or.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nData field realty and our type okay, if type is not empty so we can use condition is filled in.\n  - If this condition is true, \nthen we will use action show elements on the.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nPage and we can decide what element.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWill be shown to be.\n  - Input column of a comment Text comment Okay, so if type is filled in comment will be visible.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSave our page.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow and let's check how it will be physically working for us.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAs you can see, each time you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDevelop something, this is very important to immediately test it when it's ready and.\n  - --- Page 103 ---\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWhen you make many different changes you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nMay think of okay, I will do many changes, then I will test them in total.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI do not recommend you to follow this approach, so it's much better and more safer.\n  - If you will do some small step, \nthen you go to your system and.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nStart to test it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThen you do another small step, then you do another test.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThe reason is that creature client side sometimes could bring you Surprises and it will be not so clear according to.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThe error message text in your browser console to understand what exact part is gave you such a surprise.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it's better to make small steps and to test it frequently.\n  - So once you get and start to.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 104 ---\n\nGet some error messages and you will.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nEasily understand that it was caused probably the most latest recent changes and you.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nShould take care about it and maybe.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nRevert them maybe to look carefully and.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nYou will find some errors.\n  - So small steps and frequent testing.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo let's open any record type is set, Comment is visible.\n  - It's clear the type.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nNow you see it's a bit uncertain.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it's not cleared and let's set it again.\n  - Okay, if you clear it doesn't work.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI think that we have a problem because of initial state of the square column.\n  - Let me show you how we can fix it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 105 ---\n\nInitial state should be aligned with our business rule and in case if we check some condition and turn this column \non.\n  - So make it visible.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd according to the business rule, it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWill be enabled if type changed and became not empty.\n  - Let's check it out.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWe need to reload.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFighting with browser cache Clear.\n  - Now you see our comment disappeared.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIf we change type, it appears again.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf you clear, it hides.\n  - Hides?\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo that's how you can manage visibility and such setting.\n  - As you can see, it's a no code setting.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo you can make all the settings with your mouse.\n  - It doesn't require any programming.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nI would like you to see another example.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo you can also see visibility, editability and required property.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd one more thing which is interesting.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nI think is about selecting values in lookups.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNow we have selection of manager from contact.\n  - We can display additional columns here.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFor example, contact type.\n  - Okay, I'm too lazy to scroll.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNow you see some contexts have customer type, some contexts have employee type, and so on.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFinally, my contacts list will include many.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nDifferent persons and only some of them.\n  - --- Page 107 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWill represent my company employees.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWhen I want to specify manager here, I definitely want to specify someone who.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIs company employee and not just a random contact.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo I want to make some simple.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFilter here which will help me to select only context with a certain type.\n  - And we can do such filtering with.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nThe help of business rules.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo let's go back to our page, go to business rules Now I plan to use object level business rules.\n  - So here you see real \nto business rules which means realty object business rules.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nHere was page.\n  - Now here is object level.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay and first of all I will check available action here.\n  - --- Page 108 ---\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd in comparison with page level we.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHave more options here and I plan to use simple static filter Business rule Static filter will not require any as you can \nsee, static filter will not.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nRequire any special conditions I mean for.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTriggering so it will be applied always.\n  - That's why it's called static.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd I will have a column which.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nColumn I plan to use for filtering.\n  - This will be manager column and what.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nFilter I plan to use I have.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo specify it with additional condition.\n  - Please note here those of you who use Windows Home probably you may \nexperience difficulties because it was found that users with Windows Home experienced troubles opening this tab \nand it was simply not possible if you use Home Edition.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 109 ---\n\nI can make condition here.\n  - Contact.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nType equals to a constant employee.\n  - So if this filter will be constantly applied on my lookup, save it and then save it \nagain.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNow let's try to select values.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHere you select data.\n  - Now you see only context with employee type.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, let's make more examples, better examples.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd let's go to customer 360 add more contacts to make it representative and let's make a contact name something \nlike James Bond and type will be customer.\n  - Okay, one more Bruce Lee will be our employee.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd Bruce Willis will be also our employee.\n  - So you will see we have some.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDifferent contexts, different types and let's go back to our realty, try to select manager system only shows us only \ncontext with a certain type.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 110 ---\n\nThis is very simple filtering tool.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAs you can see we just used only mouse to set up this type of customization.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nBut it's very efficient and that's why I think it's important for you to know about it.\n  - Because even if it doesn't require \nprogramming, but if you did not attend our.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nCustomization course, you still need to know.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThat such type of filtering is supported.\n  - Also I can quickly show you another filtering of connected fields like filtering \ncities by countries.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo or maybe if we focus on us only.\n  - For example we can filter cities by States.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo let's go again to our page.\n  - In order to filter something by something.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOf course we need to have connected lookups.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 111 ---\n\nLuckily in base product cities and countries are already connected.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nEach city has corresponding country reference.\n  - Let me show you cities lookup already has connections with country.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nProbably we have to start from country.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBecause we plan to input data starting from country providing country value and then USR country copy and lookup.\n  - We will use standard lookup.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nThat will be based on.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt's also CT drop down list.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd here we can name something like city.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt will be enough.\n  - The most important is uniqueness of this column.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 112 ---\n\nGood unique value for us.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay.\n  - Is it okay?\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSave it first in order to apply.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nChanges to the object level.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd so to fully modify our data model properly to take maybe less than a minute our time it okay, saved.\n  - Well, now \nwe go to business rules.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nThis is a special type of filter.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWhich is I think originally designed for connected lookups.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd we can specify what column to filter.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nObviously we will filter cities by what another column by country.\n  - --- Page 113 ---\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd this editor will automatically detect connections between cities and countries.\n  - So it will show us where city.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nCountry which means country value inside of city Lookup equals to value of country.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nProvided in our realty page and also automatic settings for clearing when country changed.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nClearing cities when country changed or automatically.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSet country if city was set and.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFor example country was empty.\n  - So you can do this also then.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCountry will be automatically populated.\n  - So this rule will work good for us.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut what I need to add here is triggering condition.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 114 ---\n\nWe need to Change such filter each time.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWhen country changes so page is opened or some changes and when country.\n  - Okay, we can select here is filled in.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWorking with this filter.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSometimes it will work, sometimes not.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo you should not forget about this condition.\n  - Let's save it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSave page and then we will test it.\n  - You will see how it works.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, let's test.\n  - We need to reward it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo let's say Miami and you see.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCountry, you see city.\n  - --- Page 115 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, Country, States, United States.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCities.\n  - As you may see, cities are filtered by country.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOh, Hartford, Frankfort.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nLooks like only.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nUS Cities I think.\n  - Okay, so now you see it looks.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nLooks like.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWell, okay, let's take another example.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNo country, you see all cities from different country.\n  - Ararat Astrakhan, Baghdad, you see Bishkek, you see Bratislava.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo from different countries from.\n  - --- Page 116 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, so if you set some city.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCountry will be populated automatically in this case.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut if you clear country, city was cleared automatically.\n  - So if we provide some country like Bangladesh, you will see \nonly filtered cities.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nLet's go to our states.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow we have to search for Seattle.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nYes, you see it finds and filter works well.\n  - So this type of filtering can be.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDone not only for citizen countries.\n  - For example, you can make two connected hookups.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd subtype should have a lookup column.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 117 ---\n\nReferencing to corresponding type.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd in this case when user specifies.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nType, it will be technically possible to filter subtypes according to selected type.\n  - But this canonic example with \ncountries and cities, I think it's the easiest to.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nUnderstand examples so you can also use it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDon't forget about business rules triggering by changing country.\n  - So save it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nHave one more session tomorrow that will be dedicated to our client side.\n  - I plan to show you how to make details \nand also probably answer your questions if appear.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf you ask something about some cases with programming inside of our pages in.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nFreedom UI later we probably will also.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nInvest a bit of time into classic.\n  - --- Page 118 ---\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nUI examples and I think you'll be.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nInterested in migration from Classic UI to Freedom ui.\n  - It will be only client side, so objects will be the same.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nToday, our session is over.\n  - In case.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nEnvironments, with your homework, tell me please.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIt's important for me to know.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDo you have any troubles or other notes, any questions?\n• Speaker 4\n  - # Speaker 4\n\nI have one.\n  - Did we go over.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou probably asked about something that you.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 119 ---\n\nAlready saw in Classic UI with overriding of methods or this is something else.\n  - So can you explain the business \nexample?\n• Speaker 4\n  - # Speaker 4\n\nNo, sorry, I just saw it on the list on.\n  - So you know you have the list of the breakdown of each day.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOh, you mean this one?\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThis is.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYeah, yeah.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo this schedule is a bit outdated unfortunately.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, try to find some time and yes, there are some topics that are not so applicable to Freedom UI and.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nYou may find something like.\n  - Like alternative JavaScript editors.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, I can explain you something and overriding of methods.\n  - --- Page 120 ---\n• Speaker 4\n  - # Speaker 4\n\nThat's it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt was possible in Classic ui, but it looks like fully not supported and not practical in Freedom ui.\n  - In Classic UI you \ncould rewrite or.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nInterfere into some life cycle stages of.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nPage by replacing its like critically important methods.\n  - In Freedom UI you can write your.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOwn methods, but system does not allow.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou to significantly change this life cycle.\n  - So it looks like I tried and.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIt looks like when you have for.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nExample some handler and you already know that there is a base product handler which is declared somewhere in \nparent.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 121 ---\n\nTemplates, you cannot replace it with your own rejecting execution of all parent implementation.\n  - So in Freedom UI \nyou can write.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYour own part and it will be.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nJust part of all the steps executed.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIn total and you can't break the way how pages code and what handlers are called there until you will write your own \ncontrol I think so in Freedom UI we have different conditions for programming.\n  - I plan to update this program for.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOur sessions and it's a bit outdated.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHere, but I try to provide you the latest useful material and in the order which looks like the most, let's say natural.\n  - So \nwhen you do simple settings then.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nYou do a bit more.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nMore complex and so our flow of real topics that we study, I think it's quite optimal for current version.\n• Speaker 4\n  - # Speaker 4\n\nThanks Mario.\n  - --- Page 122 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThank you Paddy for questions and any.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAny, any difficulties with your homework, when you do examples, when you make.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYour sections, maybe you have something to say.\n  - It happens that most of our participants watch videos like you now \nand then.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nThey decided to process video files much.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLater than finishing of the sessions.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo I recommend you to invest some time between the sessions to watch videos and practice.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBecause in this case you will easier.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nUnderstand our next topics.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 123 ---\n\nYou will get more experience at that topics and think it will be in.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nGeneral faster for you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it will be faster boarding faster, let's say getting necessary expertise for you as developers.\n  - So at the end of the \nsessions.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nYou'Ll be able to pass an exam.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe call it Fast Track certification, which.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIncludes homework very similar to what we do here and test.\n  - This test will require some time for you to prepare.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDetails how we will prepare for the exam, how it will be organized and.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nThis is optional thing.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo if you feel confident, you may apply for it.\n  - If not, you may use Academy website and apply for certification much \nlater.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo if interested in preparation for the.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nExam, also keep it in your mind.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd if you have some questions, feel free to ask.\n  - Also maybe you will want to write me some messages.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHere is my email.\n  - I will be happy to answer you and support you during your practicing with.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nExamples in our sessions.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThank you for your time today.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSee you tomorrow as usual.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd as usual, you will receive videos of today's session very soon, maybe 40 or 50 minutes to get this video.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nThank you and goodbye.\n  - --- Page 125 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSee you tomorrow.\n  - Bye.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIt.\n\nKey Concepts: server, database, sql, data, package",
