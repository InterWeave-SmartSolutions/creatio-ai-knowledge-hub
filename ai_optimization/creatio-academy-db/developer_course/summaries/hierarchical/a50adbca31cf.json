# Speaker 2\n\nMade some required fields and it was.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nPretty much easy and we used only.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nNo code customization tools for this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAlso we managed to make a button which had a custom handler.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo we made a button push me button and this custom handler shows some console output.\n  - We can also display \nsome pop up.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nMessages and also we can do any kind of JavaScript code behind this button.\n  - Today I will show you a bit.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nMore complicated examples of how you can.\n  - --- Page 2 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDo some programming and coding and also we will discuss debugging.\n  - So you will see how it's possible to stop \nexecution of your code and.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nMake it executed line by line.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBy line and to see all the.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nVariables and to see all the conditions.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo so to make something that you probably get used to do when you operate with any like modern version, modern.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nDevelopment environment like Visual Studio or other so today question today's session I would.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLike to warm up with Simple Question.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWhich is about organizing of your sections.\n  - It's probably not so obvious so I.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWill tell you all apps it's like Synthetic Workplace which includes all registered sections in one list.\n  - --- Page 3 ---\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWe have Studio out of the box.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWorkplace, we have customer360 because it's a result of loaded contacts and accounts.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo our loaded customer360 app also caused creation of new Workplace.\n  - Such workplaces also can be created, you \ncan manage them and you can put your sections into it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nI would like to show you something.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThat I think will be useful.\n  - It's about organizing of Workplace for your users and for my developer purpose it will be \nquite often when we will.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNeed to switch between our created section.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd some system sections like Process library, process logs or lookups and system settings.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo I plan simply to put my new Created Reality section into this Studio Workplace.\n  - That will be very easy, but I need \nto demonstrate it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\nThen find Workplace Setup.\n  - Workplace Setup helps us to create new workplace or to manage existing workplaces.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nPresent but not shown even if we are administrators.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo that it's very interesting because it's one of not so many places where.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nUser permissions Are still matter when we run system under administrator privilege.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo now you can see I see only four workplaces.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut in total it looks like we.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nHave at least 5.\n  - And productivity workplace seems to not showing anything and not having any permission settings.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo that's probably why we are not seeing it.\n  - Okay, let's go to studio workplace.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\nWe have set of sections for a workplace.\n  - Also it will be interesting for you to know that sections have positions.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLet me show you columns set up for sections list.\n  - We can arrange and add the position column.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nNow you will understand why I display this position.\n  - Any section in a workplace has its position and position \norganizes order.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf we rearrange such items such sections.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nPosition will be changed.\n  - And finally your sections will be displayed in a different order.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSometimes this order is not so consistent.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nYou see UI management and message templates, they have the same position.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd sometimes UI management will be on top.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSometimes message templates will be on top.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\nDepending on how data will be loaded at a certain time.\n  - Because sorting by this position it makes some ambitious \nresult.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI plan to add one more section in the list system will show me only sections that are not listed here.\n  - And it's \ninteresting to see here that we have couple of accounts section.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt's very unusual.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCouple of calls and couple of contacts.\n  - One of the possible explanation why we.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHave two different account section is that.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOne of them is section for Classic.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nUi, another is Freedom UI section.\n  - We can also display columns here which.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWill let you understand what we are looking at.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo we can just squeeze a bit title display e.g.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n\nCreated on column save column settings.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow when we try to add you.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWill see title, you will see created on and one of them is 19, another is 24.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd it looks like first one is classic UI, second one which is younger.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThis is freedom UI.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo that's how you can detect which one is necessary for you to add.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIn my case, I plan to find realty section created recently and we can see it at the end of this list.\n  - You see, its position \nis also not so consistent.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut it guarantees that it will be at the end.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nBut it's not so comfortable to see this item at the very end of this list.\n  - So possibly we would like to move it upper.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo let's go to do this.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nYou can move it even on the first top position.\n  - Unfortunately we cannot move it upper than home.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt if you want and realty will be position zero.\n  - So when we save it we can.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAlso reward this page.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nProbably we will see our reality section.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nDirectly at Studio Workplace at zero position.\n  - But it's also important to say that other items were changed so they \nchanged.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTheir position because reality shifted them.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo if we want to transport such change, we must make a corresponding data item.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOr we can use help of data binding tool.\n  - --- Page 9 ---\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThis data binding tool helps us to.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nRemember positions of O sections here and we can just click Bind Workplace, specify.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nTarget package and click save.\n  - Then we can see what was created.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd when we for example try to.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nActualize data and save it, we will.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSee warning and this warning will tell us that such Studio Workplace was already.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nRegistered somewhere in parent package.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd even more it was registered one more time in another parent package.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\nBut it's not a big mistake.\n  - So it's not a mistake at all.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSuch data is already present somewhere in parent packages data items.\n  - So maybe we are doing it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIt'S not a mistake.\n  - Another one is sys module in Workplace.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo you can see data and you can see all the sections in Workplace.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nStudio were listed here.\n  - And also it's important to mention that forced update option must be applied for.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nPosition column because otherwise update or position.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWill be not performed.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou probably remember from our Tuesday session that when you create data items, it's.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nPossible that you will make data item that will perform update, not an insert.\n  - --- Page 11 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIn case of update in case of.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nTarget record was found.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBy the way, I prefer to make it not by this key.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI prefer to make it by this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nKey and found by id.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo if record was found by ID.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd then it will update target database.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAccording to loaded data and in our case only position will be updated.\n  - Okay, we can save it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nNow you can see that save was.\n  - --- Page 12 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSuccessful, but we have a lot of warnings related to parent data that was already registered in base product.\n  - And \nthis is valid set of warnings because our change caused the change of position of all previously registered sections \nin Studio Workplace.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nHad a warning that tells us that you're trying to Change the data which was originally declared somewhere else.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo maybe you're doing it wrong.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo please take care.\n  - Here is your warning.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut this warning is still so we can ignore this.\n  - And last one is admin unit in workplace.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThis is about access permissions.\n  - System administrators have full access to Studio.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWorkplace and probably this data is also.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nPresent in our database.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\nYes, so maybe not so necessary to save it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo it's warning, not an error in case if you have an error.\n  - For example, you save the same data twice in the same \npackage.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIn this case, save button will show you error message and save button will not disappear.\n  - If save button was \ndisappeared, means your.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nData item was normally saved.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf save button did not disappear, it means an error.\n  - It's like serious mistake and the system.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWill not allow you to save such data.\n  - It happens only when you save the.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSame data twice in the same package.\n  - Okay, so it was set of client modules of sorry, set of data items.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAutomatically created by help of data binding tool.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWhen we registered our reality section in a studio workplace, now we have comfort.\n  - Here is our new created section.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nHere we have lookups which we also often look at.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd we'll use it and some other.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSystem sections that we may need.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo we now have very comfortable conditions and easy transitions between different sections.\n  - So it was just a \nsimple example how you can organize your workplaces in.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nMore complicated based products like sales, service and marketing.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou will see more workplaces, more sections inside.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd you also can create your own workplace with sections that you think will be necessary to use for your end.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nUsers with particular roles.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\nAnd you can provide permissions for such.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSections and for such workplaces.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd what is important for you to understand that you can create many different.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWorkplaces and include the same section many times.\n  - So if you added some section to some workplace, it doesn't \nmean that you can't do it with another workplace.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIn different places with no limitations.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIn my case, I have my applications.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWorkplace with real T section and I also have.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nJust a second.\n  - So what I wanted to show you.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWe can use the same section in.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\nDifferent workplaces and it's not a problem if we specify the same section in.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nDifferent workplaces many times.\n  - So physically this is the same section.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThe same data shown in different places.\n  - Just a second.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI think will be interesting for you to know.\n  - So let's do something more serious.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou can do some more serious programming.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nInside of Creature client side page using.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSome JavaScript and using creature tools and let's say data platform.\n  - First of all I will explain you some business \nideas.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nPlan is to show you some recalculations and it could be a good example.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n\nIf we for example create one more column, call it commission.\n  - So it will be our future profit from the deal.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd also we have to take care.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAbout the type offer.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo for sale we have one formula.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd for rental we will have another formula.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, let's do it step by step.\n  - So first of all we need new column.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNew column can be added to this very easily.\n  - We can just go to modify our page.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCarefully dropping it here it will be named Commission.\n  - And as we have a price in.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nUS dollars, so let it be a commission.\n  - Also in the same currency, the inner column name will be USR.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCommission.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd we confirm such code for this column.\n  - The data format will be decimal with two digits.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nTo manually change it.\n  - That's why I will set read only.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOption on I temporary hide place attachments tab.\n  - So my commission will be read only.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd also just to make it easier.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo find in div array, I will name its element code so we can type it as we wish Commission USD.\n  - Let it be our element \ncode.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nThis element code will be used in.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nView config, div and also physically it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 19 ---\n\nWill be used for building real page.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nHTML markup with set of divs inside.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd this code will be used.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nTo name set of items and div HTML tags inside of our page.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo element code, it's about physical component.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nRepresentation on the page.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, you already know this and that's all I can just save System will.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAutomatically modify our object.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt will save changes to our page code which we can find here if.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\nWe click open source code.\n  - So now let's just click save and.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThat'S probably will be enough for the beginning.\n  - So this change will be made in objects and in our client module.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, we can move on.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd now we can close this page editor.\n  - Go to main page.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAs you can see, I did not even reload it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe can just open it again and.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nProbably we will immediately see our new column and it's read only.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo you see this lock sign which.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nTells us that column is read only.\n  - So now we need to think of.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nImplementing read calculation and it will be.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nTriggered by change of price.\n  - And also we want to make it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDependent on offer type.\n  - So for the sales offer type it.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWill be more or less okay if.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe make commission like 2% from list price from our price of realty shown here.\n  - So to be quite fair and good \nenough commission for our business and for.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSales it's totally okay.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow let's create some sample for house for rental.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOur rental price will be 1200 bucks.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFor some house in Miami.\n  - --- Page 22 ---\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nI'm not sure that can we find.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo cheap houses in Miami for maybe it's not like not in a high.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSeason and some area.\n  - And as you can see, commission will be recalculated.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n50% from monthly payment price if this is a rental.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo for rentals we will have another percentage.\n  - So for sales it will be 1% or 2% value.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd for rental it will be 50% from price value.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo when we will do some calculation we have to take care about it.\n  - But also you should be mentally ready.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThat in real life business it really.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n\nOften happens that such ratios, such formulas.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nCan be changed from time to time.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd once we introduce hard coded value like 2% a month later our customer.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nMay call us and say, you know.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNow conditions were changed so we need to modify this percent and now it will be 2.5.\n  - Could you please change it?\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it will be really expensive.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nTo make such changes.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd our customer will be not ready.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWill be not really happy if we.\n  - --- Page 24 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAsk for example for half, maybe for a couple of hours of work to be paid.\n  - If we want to change just one number.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIdeally customers should be able to change such ratios themselves.\n  - We have several options to do this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTable which will keep necessary percents.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOr we can use some system settings for this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOr as you can see, our ratio is really stick to offer type.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo probably we can add new column.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo offer type lookup in order to save one value in percent for sales.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd another value in percent for rentals.\n  - I will show you how we can do this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n\nIn this case you can do the same if you.\n  - Oh, I did not save it.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nGreat.\n  - So if you prefer to focus on application, you can go to Application hub, you may find your realty app, you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nMight check your data models and that's.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nHow you can find corresponding object.\n  - Or you can switch to advanced settings to see all the contents of your \nsolution.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo I just get used to work.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWith this configuration section.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAlso it has some useful actions like.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSave packages to file system.\n  - So that's why I stick to this.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nApproach and I feel more confident when.\n  - --- Page 26 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWork here because I have full available.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSet of tools to manage my system set my system configuration setup.\n  - So we opened corresponding object, we have \ninheritance from base lookup and that's why we have eight inherited columns and we did not add any other own \ncolumns so far.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo for each reality offer type for.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nRental or sale, we can add one more column to be number.\n  - Maybe we can do it with quite high precision.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, two digits after decimal point.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWe can call it something like commission percent.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo we can even specify what is.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nThe available range of our data values here just to make it clear for any user what type of value should be put here.\n  - So if we specify from 0 to 100 it means from 0 to 100%.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n\nAnd it will be clear how to.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nPut some value here if you want.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nTo save for example 2%.\n  - One more column is not a big deal, so we can easily add it save and publish.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut after we do this we may.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nStart to get some additional unexpected difficulties.\n  - Now I will show it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd for example lookups.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nLet's go to reality offer type lookup and let's try to see its data.\n  - Now we have name and description.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWith some initial values for calculations.\n  - --- Page 28 ---\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd we agreed that for a sale it will be enough for us to specify 2%.\n  - According to this helpful message, 2% will look \nlike this 2.00, so it means just 2.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOffer type object.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo not object data item for this.\n  - Let me find it.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIt looks like we still did not need to do any additional steps related.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo adding new column into existing object.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nBut some of you may start to feel some difficulties and such difficulties are connected with the way how server side \nsystem remembers information about objects.\n  - And unfortunately it may happen that your kind of difficulty which you \nwill finally face will be inability to display data here or inability to use new column a bit later.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n\nSo let's go.\n  - Now we have offer type which also has additional data.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThe top where we can easily use such data columns.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNow I plan to show you how to get data out from a lookup.\n  - We will use again page editor.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNow you will see this trick how we can make data out from existing lookup.\n  - We have new fields here, but if you add \nany it will add new.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nColumn to your object and it will.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAdd a new control to your page.\n  - So such columns I would like to call data fields and data fields represents \nconnection between controls and real life data column of your main object that this page works with.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSave data from them or at least.\n  - --- Page 30 ---\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNot save into main primary object with the standard tools.\n  - So maybe you will save it somewhere somehow else.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIt will show us all existing lookup columns in our realty object and then we will find offer type extended and system \nwill show us only suitable on the compatible field which will be you can be used within decimal number control.\n  - This \nis our commission percent so we will select it and here now you will see some changes.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo simply speaking we made read only column that will be automatically loaded each time offer type is set and each \ntime offer type changed or cleared.\n  - Let's save our changes and we will see how it works.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nA while, tell me please.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOkay, Monica, thank you again.\n  - Secret and Rakhi, thank you for mentioning.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n\nWe can read it from the database if we use related objects, if we use offer type and if we display commission \npercent and this commission percent will be obtained from corresponding record from our offer type.\n  - But you see, \nnow we have some troubles.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nBut if you click there and back to sale now you see this value is okay, save, close, open and still it doesn't work.\n  - So \nwe still have some problem with this additional column.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd this problem unfortunately cannot be solved.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nBy logging out and logging in.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo let me show you.\n  - I try to log out.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nMaybe thinking.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThere is something like a user session cache issue.\n  - Then I try to log in.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWhen you work with client side, it's.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 32 ---\n\nBetter to keep your browser console on.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nProbably you will see some interesting messages.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThere or a lot of red messages.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIn case of errors.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it's important to see it quick.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, opening our realty section, ignoring all.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWarnings here, open it once again and you see no, it did not help us.\n  - So unfortunately logging out and logging in.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nDoesn'T help you and the only solution.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWhich we can do is restart our app or shut it down and start.\n  - --- Page 33 ---\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIt again for example with the help of IIS Manager.\n  - But it will take more than minute for us to normally shut down and \nstart.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThis is restart our app and we.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nHave a maintenance tools for this restart application.\n  - This is the only way to quickly fix this issue.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow you see we have some.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nErrors in browser console, but it looks.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nLike not very critical.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo now restart is being performed.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWe can check what's happening with our memory and with our processes using task manage.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 34 ---\n\nW3WP .\n  - Looks like we have the same worker.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nProcess, but it has a comment to.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nRestart so possibly to rewards some of its assemblies.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, so we restarted our app.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe go to reality section.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nNow we already will see the difference.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow you see that commission percent here.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWas normally displayed in this list previously it was not normal.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd if we open any record now.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 35 ---\n\nCommission percent will be fully normally loaded.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWhen we just open the page.\n  - So you see commission percent loaded correctly if you take any other value.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo now we fixed it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd that's why I had to use this add on called maintenance tools for creature.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSuch add on helps me easily restart.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThe app with just waiting approximately 10 seconds.\n  - And it's much easier than restarting my app by shutting down \nand starting again.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nMy worker process or recycling worker process.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt's possible, so it will take significantly longer.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, so we fixed this question with.\n  - --- Page 36 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThe commission percent and now.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOur task.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIs.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo make actual calculation.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo now we can think of how.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo trace changes of price or commission percent.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nLuckily commission percent will be available for.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nUs the same as any attribute for a real column.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo commission percent will be also an attribute for us.\n  - --- Page 37 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo if this value changes or if.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThis value changes, as you can see.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt will be changed in case if you clear in case if you set.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSome offer type or if you change to another offer type, commission percent is changed.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo price or commission percent should trigger recalculation of commission.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI will show you how we can do this.\n  - Let's go to our configuration section.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFind client modules.\n  - We are working with form page.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAndrean is asking is it possible to use this add on in a cloud environment?\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n\nYes, all creation apps from Marketplace can be installed on cloud systems.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAbsolutely the same as you can install it locally.\n  - When you install any add on, you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nUse only web interface.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo it will work absolutely the same.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nLet me show you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo you go to Settings, you go to Application management, Application Hub and then you click Install or Add new \napplication.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd you can select something from this.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nList or you can select Marketplace Powered.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd it will work absolutely the same.\n  - --- Page 39 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf you run it in cloud.\n  - Thank you Adrian for your interesting question.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWe decided to open directly its source code.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThat's how we open this tab.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWe can try to find our commission diff part.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou can see this our commission column.\n  - It was added by help of page editor.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo practically we should not modify this.\n  - But it will be interesting to see how it will be connected with the.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nData attribute PDS USR commission USR so.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThis is our attribute name.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, we can collapse temporary all such things.\n  - --- Page 40 ---\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI will only show you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo price.\n  - Okay, we need price, we need commission so we can collapse all other new config div items till we will face \nview model config.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSet of variables that can be saved.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOn the page level.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd we already started to work with.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt yesterday I just tried to explain you such attributes and now we will work with them.\n  - So for the price column we \nsee this attribute name.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWe have this attribute name and finally.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe will save our data into commission.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 41 ---\n\nAttribute which has this name.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThis is important.\n  - Okay, I will collapse anything else to make it clear and quite compact for you.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nPercent attribute and commission attribute.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay?\n  - Nothing else.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nModel config is not interesting.\n  - And then we will do something with handlers.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nI already have an example which will.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nMake it possible for us to do it quickly.\n  - So let me show you this example of the code examples reading UI and then \nwe need calculated field example.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nField example.\n  - So now I will use a special.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nPre designed handler name.\n  - Probably we need to look at Academy.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo explain all possible handler names.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo let's go to Academy, let's go.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo go to guides development.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nFront end.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFreedom UI and somewhere we will see some client schema references handlers.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nYes, this is an article explaining handlers and their definition.\n  - So we have some set of standard names for handlers \nand they represent some.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nImportant steps of page life cycle.\n  - In our case, we are interested in the handler which is triggered each time when \nsome data, some attribute data changed.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAt our page changes the attribute.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n\nSo this handler is called handle view.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nModel attribute change request.\n  - Let me show you my example.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo simply speaking, this handler will be.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nCalled each time when any column value.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nChanges at our user at our client.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSide page in our browser.\n  - So this handler will be triggered quite often.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe will also.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nPaste it for you and we will copy it and put it to our examples in our handlers area.\n  - So this is an array, we have to \nkeep syntax well.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt like this, keeping commas, brackets and so on.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 44 ---\n\nSo now you see, this piece of code was just simply added.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThis piece of code was added and let's check what we can do with it.\n  - Of course we have to take care about attribute \nnames because they are always unique.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo how we can check it?\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThis handler will be called quite often for each column change.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd in order to make it efficient.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe need to check if some column.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThat we are interested had changed or not.\n  - If yes, then we do our recalculation.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf not, we should do nothing in.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOrder to save system resources.\n  - So we check request property here and.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe have attribute name.\n  - And if this attribute name is our price, then this is logical or attribute name is our \ncommission percent.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThen we do some calculation, but we.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHave to actualize our names so you.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCan see our list of attributes for the price.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHere is our attribute name.\n  - Let's copy it and carefully paste here.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo how we do this?\n  - I already showed you yesterday.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe have to use operator await.\n  - Then request is our argument dollar context and then we have access to our certain \nattribute.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo we have just a variable in.\n  - --- Page 46 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOur JavaScript code for price for percent.\n  - Then we do calculation of commission as result of multiplication and don't \nForget to.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nDivide by 100 because commission percent represents.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nPercent, not just a decimal value.\n  - Okay, and then we will save our commission percent.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIf we do it incorrectly, we will fail.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo this is important.\n  - Our commission value will be finally saved into this.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nI provided an example for you, so you can also check out your example.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nJust a second.\n  - Okay, saving was successful and we can move on with our checks.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nProbably it's because of cache.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 47 ---\n\nSo let's reload the page.\n  - Reloading helps to fight with browser cache effect.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nNow you can see that recalculation works well.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo we have our price for rental of our apartment.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd you see our commission is correctly.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nRecalculated and we can save our data.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCommission will be also saved.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe can see it here.\n  - Commission is our legal valid column, so it will be saved.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nLet's open some sale example.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow you can see.\n  - --- Page 48 ---\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, price was not changed.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nCommission is already calculated.\n  - Let's check if we switch from sale to rental.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nYou see, commission was recalculated.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf we switch back to sale, it's.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAlso quite well calculated.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo now you see that our commission is quite fair for this amount of price for the house.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo our recalculation also works well and.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt shows even when page is opened.\n  - It looks like when page is opened our data filled in client side.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 49 ---\n\nDo not change anything.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut just open the page.\n  - Yes, we'll see.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo it looks like our calculation is.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAlready done and works quite well.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd of course everything works quite smoothly.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWhen we have a pre programmed examples where everything is correct.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nBut in real life you will do.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYour own examples where some errors or mistakes could happen.\n  - So you will need to know how to debug this code.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI will show you how to make.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSuch debug and you will see that's not so difficult.\n  - One of the easiest ways to debug.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIs to put a special debugger breakpoint into your code.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLike this, the word debugger.\n  - If you provide such debugger statement, it means that you ask for debug session and \nyou stop execution of your JavaScript code.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo if browser developer console is on.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThen your debugging will work for you.\n  - But this approach has also disadvantage.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd when you finished your debugging, you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nShould not forget to remove all your debugger lines.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSave your changes again.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd ideally you have to run your.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 51 ---\n\nLogic again just to make sure you did not accidentally damage anything.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBecause when you save, you have chance that something will be incorrectly saved.\n  - Something will go not so well.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI need to explain and I need to show you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe can go to this is easy.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWay to put debugger word.\n  - I will show you a bit more professional way to debug.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThen we enable browser developer console.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nYou can do it by F12 or control shift I.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd when you do this, you then.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nGo to Sources tab.\n  - You see, we already opened some set of scripts here.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLet's close everything and then we can.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nJust search and you see we have.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nA USR reality form page part of the URL.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo it's a page, it's a name.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOf client module and we can try to find it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nControl p Open file.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLet's try Control p open file.\n  - Which one?\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, if you do not want to.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nGuess which one is correct, we can go back reload the page.\n  - --- Page 53 ---\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo we will suppress any kind of.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nCache and then we will open it again.\n  - And we have just one option, single option to select corresponding file Control \nP .\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd you see only one form page here.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo no any cached, no any duplicates that will make you confused.\n  - And you probably may select Incorrect 1.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSee set of equalizable strings here.\n  - But the most important of course is our code.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBig part with view config div some.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nPart view model config.\n  - And finally you will have your header handlers.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFor example, we can click on this.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 54 ---\n\nLine number which will make a breakpoint for us.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it's the same as debugger, but.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIt doesn't change the source of our client module.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo we can use browser debugging tools for this.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nClick on the line number.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThat's how we activate breakpoint.\n  - So here we have one breakpoint that we just clicked here.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nExecution will be stopped.\n  - Let me show you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf you change for example offer type from rental to sale, you see These.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 55 ---\n\nLines are executed and now code stops and we can go line by line.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow we have to use tools that.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWill help us to proceed with this piece.\n  - The most popular, I think the Most.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nEfficient is F10 which is a step over running of a line without going into sub functions for it.\n  - So I will press F10.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThen you can see commission was recalculated.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow you will see commission will be set here.\n  - So my commission is now 26, so I expect it to be saved here.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nYes, 26 and then we move on.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo here we can use resume F8 hotkey to normally continue execution.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThat's how we can check this code.\n  - If we change the price.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 56 ---\n\nYou will see the Same I press F10 I have another commission F8.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, we can make more serious price.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFor an apartment.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd obviously we'll have more serious commission.\n  - So that's how you can debug your code.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAlso, if your code has something has.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSome obvious mistakes and causes runtime errors, you will also see such runtime errors in your sources tab.\n  - You \nwill also see your console which will be full of red messages.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow let's check.\n  - You see that percent is empty so percent is null.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo that's how we will clear.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, when we have some valid percent, we can move on with F8 and you see setting is done.\n  - --- Page 57 ---\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIf you have any questions related to this debugging, please tell me.\n  - As you can see, debugging can be.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nReally effective if your code is more.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nComplex, if you have sub functions.\n  - If you are not sure what values you finally get from your code so you can check \nit out with the help of browser developer tools.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nDifferent validators so different clones will be used for universal validation.\n  - And also I plan to show you some \nexamples of so we already displayed debugging but also you need to know a bit more about logging.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nForeign.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo today I want you to see.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSome more technical things about how client side works and how we can do.\n  - --- Page 58 ---\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSome technical steps with it.\n  - So we already know how to debug our code.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo I will show you login mechanisms.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nThat are available on Creature platform.\n  - Here is our installed app and this is our folder with installed application.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo provide the different logs and save them In Creature web server.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nThe most important log file for us is invoke targets config because here we can change default file to save our all \ndefault folder to save all our logs.\n  - You may be interested in the way how we can do some logging.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAs well appender so they are synonym.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nLogger or appender they are synonyms.\n  - So you can see a lot of different loggers registered and appenders are \nsettings that will collect log messages.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nLogical thing that you can use in your program code.\n  - Appender is a place that is used to collect your data and save\n\n--- Page 59 ---\n\nit.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo we have a lot of loggers, a lot of targets.\n  - Sorry, targets.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nBy default this folder is somewhere in temp Catalog Windows temp I decided to make it different so we can find logs \nand as you can see we have zero which means main application logs and log folder which.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWhich.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSorry.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nA log folder which means loader part is not so interesting because it has no customizable items that will be \ninterested for us to Interesting for us to see so loader is very technical and we have just several log files here, \nnothing very spectacular.\n  - And zero folder is what we really need because it's a log set of logs for our main \napplication.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou from the maintenance point of view?\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 60 ---\n\nI think the most important is error log.\n  - Error log represents all exceptions and keeps information about all exceptions \nthat happened in your system.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt because usually it is important and.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSometimes you may find some errors which are not related to your changes.\n  - So you may simply speaking find some \nerrors from base product like this 1 error parent schema is now parent ID sets to empty and so on.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it's really hard to test everything.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd to polish any line of code.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it should show it so it.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nCould not fail in any way.\n  - So in real life, in any big system, some errors usually happen.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut in our case it's not so.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 61 ---\n\nCritical so you can simply ignore.\n  - But if you will find another errors with some user complaints, of course you should \ntake care of it.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nBut it will be more efficient for you if you can Collect logs by yourself.\n  - And that's why I plan to show you some \nspecial tool which makes it easier if you need to collect logs from cloud based environment.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIt takes just almost no time, maybe 20 seconds.\n  - And you will see that new app is installed to our system.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOkay, wait for a minute.\n  - And I'm also curious about what is happening at my website.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNow you will see one more item at our settings page.\n  - Previously called System Designer, currently it's called \nSettings.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 62 ---\n\nWe can check.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nYou probably remember we looked at our logger and appenders.\n  - So we have appenders, we have loggers here.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo we can listen for a certain.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nLogs in order to get some error.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nMessages for the certain, let's say subject or certain area of functionality.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd you can also listen everything like this, which will mean that you look and get every message.\n  - And I'll try to find a \nlogger for SQL.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nExecutor SQL log appender.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOkay, will it be DB executor?\n  - And we're only interested in for example errors.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo I plan to make example of.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 63 ---\n\nListening of DB execution errors.\n  - And I especially will do some example which makes such an error.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, let's try to delete once again.\n  - Yes, error message appears.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nLogger pattern.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nMaybe you should use info subscribe.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nI will try to delete it once again.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYes, now you see, funny thing, but.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIt was not an error, it was just a warning.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo like yellow color, which means this is not an error, just a warning.\n  - --- Page 64 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd okay, so I got some text.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nMessage from our DB executor and you see that my message has an error.\n  - So exception occurred, statement \nterminated.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nYou can also get the same logs.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf you go to your files, you.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWill find SQL JSON here we will have similar information.\n  - So you see my delete statement failed.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it conflicted with foreign reference constraint.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd it's interesting that for the SQL.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nErrors, system logs only queries that were failed.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 65 ---\n\nSo only queries that failed to be executed at the database.\n  - In my case, I intentionally made an error for the database \nlevel and showed.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou how you can handle it and.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nHow you can track it.\n  - You can also use all existing loggers for all messages subscribe.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOf your system, when you open any.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSection, you will start to get more.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd more Logs because system usually writes.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSomething to logs and it has quite verbose logging.\n  - So you will have more and more data.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nYou see more messages appeared, some of.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThem are useless for you and so.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 66 ---\n\nYou have to play a bit with it.\n  - But finally you will be able to do the same as you can do with log files.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo this can be really helpful for you.\n  - Please remember about this telemetry log and we have some buttons here.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWhat is this?\n  - As you can see we have some help message explaining how to use this some button which shows or it \nruns.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd stops a listening of logs.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo green means run, red means stopped and that's how you can also use it.\n  - So listening all of the logs will provide \nyou a lot of verbose noisy messages.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou can easily install it from Marketplace.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOkay, so what else you need to know about client site?\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe will work with details soon and.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 67 ---\n\nBefore we doing this I need to explain you how to do validation.\n  - As you can see my previous program was a bit more \noriented on classic ui.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo sometimes I jump from topics topics and that's why we are not following directly from this schedule.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo I plan to provide you material like step by step slightly improving complexity of topics.\n  - So I think it's not so hard, \nnot so difficult for you to study.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThis material this way.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo let's move on validation.\n  - What it is about and this is.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nCheck of data before it will be.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSaved at server side.\n  - Let's return back to our reality section and let's look at our data value.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNegative price as you can see as.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nA result we have negative commission.\n  - It's also possible to save negative area and also system does not prevent us \nfrom doing such things.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo we have to make some kind.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOf protection for our data input.\n  - And luckily we have this on the platform level as existing validation tools.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOur form page again, open its source code again.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd I need to show you some examples at our Academy documentation which will really help you.\n  - So we have some \narchitectural SDK things at front end documentation, but we have.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nA lot of useful examples in platform.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nCustomization area of our academy.\n  - And we have examples for Freedom UI for fields examples and we have \nexamples of population of fields.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nField which we are interested right now.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 69 ---\n\nSo I will share useful links for such articles.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nI recommend you to read it or.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nJust maybe look at it.\n  - So let me explain how we plan to move on.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it's a special designed place for us to program special functions that will be used for checks of data during input.\n  - And luckily we have examples at Academy.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWhich will help us to make it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSmoothly without spending too much time.\n  - So validators is a collection, this is not an array.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nNow you see, this is a collection.\n  - Each collection item should include its name.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd implementation and validation.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nImplementation includes validator property which is a.\n  - --- Page 70 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFunction that finally should return something set of parameters and async property.\n  - Then when we finish with this \npart, we will connect our created validator with set of columns.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCan do this and I already have.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAn example, we will not spend too.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nMuch time on it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo now you will see how we can do this validation.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nFirst of all we go to validators.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nArea and we will provide some code here.\n  - I already have example, no difficulties.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, let me copy and paste for you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 71 ---\n\nThis is example of our validation.\n  - Okay, no need to use cameras to show.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd I will also implement it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt's my own validators area.\n  - So copy and paste.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo probably we have to Start with parameters first.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBecause parameters are values that we can provide for each validated column and for different columns, we can \nprovide different parameter values.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nHere we have to declare what parameters we will have.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIn my case there are two parameters.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nMin value and message parameter.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nValidator function has a bit complex structure.\n  - This is one function, it returns another.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFunction and first function requests config, Another function requests control inside of control.\n  - Unfortunately we \nonly have value so it makes it difficult for us to analyze several values from different columns on our page.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nBut it makes it universal.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf we have value, we don't know exact column.\n  - So we can use the same validator for many different columns or \ndifferent columns and it will be universal for us.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThe config we know what parameters to expect.\n  - So we have min value parameter and we have message parameter.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOur check is quite simple.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWe get value and then compare with min value.\n  - And in case if our value is.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nGreater or equal than min value then we think that data is correct and our returned result will be null, which.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nMeans no warnings, no messages, everything is okay.\n  - But in case that value is not.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 73 ---\n\nCorrect we have to return special type.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOf result which is a JavaScript object with a specific name, the property inside.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd with the message property inside of this property.\n  - So it's kind of nested JavaScript object and our message here \nwill be text, it should be displayed nearby problem control.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd also this message will be explained.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDisplayed when we will try to save our page.\n  - So we will say try to save data system will check all the validators and it \nwill find that some columns are not correct and it will not allow to save it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo this is our example of a.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nValidation, but it's not applied yet.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo we have to set up some.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nColumns which will work with this validator.\n  - --- Page 74 ---\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOtherwise our validator is useless because no.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nColumn expect checks with it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo I do not need to change anything here.\n  - This code is universal as you can see.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOnly one hard coded thing is a validator type name.\n  - Next step is connection of validator with.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCertain columns or it's better to say with attributes.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo I will show you examples how we can connect.\n  - Maybe I should do it here.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAfter module config I have to provide.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nValidators setting so I should carefully copy this and paste it here.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 75 ---\n\nAnd that's how I will put it.\n  - So here's my price attribute.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHere is my validator.\n  - The type of validator should be matched.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWith what we created and parameter.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo the minimum value for the price.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI think it will be 50.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo we will not allow to save.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAny reality object with the price less than 50 bucks.\n  - Okay, and also we can use message, not just a plain string \nconstant which.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIs also supported, but also we can use localizable string.\n  - Here is an example of a macro.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThat you can use for localizable strings.\n  - --- Page 76 ---\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd localizable strings are saved separately and can provide translations into other languages.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo let me show you what localizable strings I plan to use.\n  - I will put it for you.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI go to localizable strings.\n  - Probably we can save it before modifications.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut now I will modify non localizable.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nStrings.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTake significantly longer than usual.\n  - As you can see, my worker process consumed quite a lot of ram.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThat's why I will try to save now.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf it saves correctly, okay, no problem.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 77 ---\n\nBut in previous versions I experienced some.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTroubles with localizable strings here and it turned out to save it.\n  - So when I added once, it physically.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAdded it twice and then denied to.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSave because it tells that such localizable string already exists.\n  - In case, if you face this kind.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOf issue when you add localizable string.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTry to save and then get error message about duplicated localizable strings.\n  - You can just remove that visible one \nthat you created.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnother one which is invisible will be still saved.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo that's how you can bypass this bug.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAs you can see, Creature also as.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 78 ---\n\nAny software, it has its own bugs.\n  - Sometimes bugs are detected, fixed new bugs appeared.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnother localizable string that we will need is about area.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo localizable string for area.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd for its.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nValue here, save it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nArea can't be less.\n  - Let's try to save.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd my intention when I save each time I add the localizable string is to check do I have any bugs with localizable \nstring.\n  - It looks like in this version this.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nBug was finally fixed.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThat's nice.\n  - So for the price we already set.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSettings, now we do the same for area.\n  - So let me show you what we.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDo for area we will set validators setting for one column.\n  - We can use multiple validators so it's possible to make \nchecks with different criterias.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd in my case for the area.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nI will use the same validator but.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nMinimum value will be 100 square feet.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo it's close to 10 square meters.\n  - We think that we will not input any kind of realty less than 10 square meters or 100 \nsquare feet.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd that's our limitation here.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAnd we will use localizable string that.\n  - --- Page 80 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWe already successfully saved.\n  - Okay, now we have this example, save.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIt and then it's our turn to.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTest and check out how our data were saved.\n  - How well it looks, we can close.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOur editor, go to main app probably.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nLet'S reward it just to fight with.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAny potential impact of browser cache issue.\n  - Then let's open any record and specially intentionally open the record \nwhich has incorrect stuff here.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nNow you see that once we finished.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd moved focus out of control, you see we have some checks and this checks displays error message.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 81 ---\n\nPrice can't be less than 50 bucks.\n  - Area can't be less than 100 square feet.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo this validation may help you to improve your logic to make it more protected to get rid of like silly mistakes made \nby end users.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd I think that this is something that will be quite important in your future projects and implementation.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nNow I plan to show you some.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSimple topic and it's simple but it's very important because such topic will be.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nQuite often faced in your projects.\n  - It will be not really directly connected with programming, but it's something that \nyou definitely should know about.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nI'm talking about typical settings of columns.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThat you need according to some conditions.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 82 ---\n\nFor example, some column must be visible.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOnly in case of a certain condition and otherwise should be hidden or another.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nColumn must be required according to some conditions and otherwise should be optional.\n  - And also you may need \nsome like talk about visibility, about required settings or about read only columns.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nFrequently faced in requirements from business owners and that's why such functionality was decided.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nTo implement as a no code Tools.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd developers code such functionality.\n  - Business rules Let me show you how you can manage such business rules \nand I will show you a couple of examples.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nPage business rules mainly used for controls.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nVisibility, maybe required property, read only property and also we have object business rules here it's called realty \nbusiness rules, but.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 83 ---\n\nYou should understand this is about object.\n  - Object business rules also offer us possibility.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo make some filtering and depending on the type of business row, it will be physically saved into metadata of a.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nPage or into metadata of an object.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo let me show you.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nLet's imagine our task is quite simple.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nTo show comment only in case of type is not empty.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo when we add new data, type.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nCould be not specified.\n  - In this case, comment should be hidden.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWe can use page level business rules.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 84 ---\n\nBecause it's about column visibility add new rule.\n  - This rule will have automatically generated title to be applied to the \npage and it has triggering condition, page is open or some condition changed.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo we have if scenario and then action.\n  - Okay, let's start with if and now we will think of something like.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nI should do it a bit better with initial status.\n  - Okay, so if our type is not empty, then comment should be visible.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nLet's try to do this attribute or.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nData field realty and our type okay, if type is not empty so we can use condition is filled in.\n  - If this condition is true, \nthen we will use action show elements on the.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nPage and we can decide what element.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWill be shown to be Input column of a comment text comment okay, so if type is filled in comment will be visible.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOtherwise comment will be hidden.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo let's try to test how it works.\n  - --- Page 85 ---\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWe can save it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSave our page.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNow and let's check how it will be physically working for us.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAs you can see, each time you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDevelop something, this is very important to immediately test it when it's ready and.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWhen you make many different changes you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nMay think of okay, I will do many changes, then I will test them in total.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI do not recommend you to follow this approach, so it's much better and more safer.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 86 ---\n\nIf you will do some small step.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThen you go to your system and.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nStart to test it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThen you do another small step, then you do another test.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThe reason is that creature client side sometimes could bring you surprises and it will be not so clear according to.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThe error message text in your browser console.\n  - To understand what exact part is gave you such a surprise.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo it's better to make small steps and to test it frequently.\n  - So once you get and start to.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nGet some error messages and you will.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nEasily understand that it was caused probably the most latest recent changes and you.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 87 ---\n\nShould take care about it and maybe.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nRevert them maybe to look carefully and.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nYou will find some errors.\n  - So small steps and frequent testing.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nType is set, Comment is visible.\n  - It's clear the type.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI think that we have a problem because of initial state of the square column.\n  - Let me show you how we can fix it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nInitial state should be aligned with our business rule and in case if we.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nCheck some condition and turn this column on.\n  - So make it visible.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nClear.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 88 ---\n\nNow you see our comment disappeared.\n  - If we set some type, it appeared again.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIf you clear, it hides.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nHides?\n  - Yes.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nWhen I want to specify manager here, I definitely want to specify someone who is company employee and not just a \nrandom contact.\n  - So I want to make some simple filter here which will help me to select only context with a certain \ntype.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nOkay and first of all I will check available action here and in comparison with page level we have more options here \nand I plan to use simple static filter Business rule Static filter will not require any as you can see static filter will not \nrequire any special conditions I mean for triggering so it will be applied always.\n  - That's why it's called static.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo please be careful when you use this home version and just know about this.\n  - So this will be temporary not \navailable for you.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 89 ---\n\nAnd then save it again.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nNow I save page and I will reload my main tab and you will see how this manager filter will work for us.\n  - Go back.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, let's make more examples better examples.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd go to customer 360 add more contacts to make it representative and let's make a contact name something like \nJames Bond and type will be customer.\n  - Okay, one more Bruce Lee will be our employee and Bruce Willis will be also \nour employee.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThis is very simple filtering tool.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAs you can see we just used only mouse to set up this type of customization.\n  - But it's very efficient and that's why.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI think it's important for you to know about it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBecause even if it doesn't require programming.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 90 ---\n\nBut if you did not attend our.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nCustomization course, you still need to know.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThat such type of filtering is supported.\n  - Also I can quickly show you another filtering of connected fields like filtering \ncities by countries.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo or maybe if we focus on us only.\n  - For example we can filter cities by states but Maybe for countries it will be more \nclear and understandable.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo let's go again to our page.\n  - In order to filter something by something.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOf course we need to have connected lookups.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nLuckily in base product cities and countries are already connected.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nEach city has corresponding country reference.\n  - Let me show you cities lookup already has connections with country.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nProbably we have to start from country.\n  - --- Page 91 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBecause we plan to input data starting from country providing country value and then USR country copy and lookup.\n  - We will use standard lookup.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThat will be based on.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt's also CT drop down list.\n  - And here we can name something like city.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nGood unique value for us.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay.\n  - Is it okay?\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nChanges to the object level.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nAnd so to fully modify our data model properly to take maybe less than a minute our time.\n  - It okay, saved.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 92 ---\n\nThis is a special type of filter.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWhich is I think originally designed for connected lookups.\n  - And we can specify what column to filter.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nBetween cities and countries.\n  - So it will show us where city.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nCountry which means country value inside of city lookup equals to value of country.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nProvided in our realty page and also automatic settings for clearing when country changed.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nClearing cities when country changed or automatically set country if city was set and for example country was \nempty.\n  - So you can do this also then country will be automatically populated.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo this rule will work good for us.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut what I need to add here is triggering condition.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWe need to change such Filter each.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 93 ---\n\nTime when country changes, so page is opened or some changes and when country.\n  - Okay, we can select here is \nfilled in.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nWorking with this filter.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSometimes it will work, sometimes not.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo you should not forget about this condition.\n  - Let's save it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSave page and then we will test it.\n  - You will see how it works.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOkay, let's test.\n  - We need to reward it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo let's say Miami and you see.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCountry, you see city.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, Country, States, United States.\n  - --- Page 94 ---\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nCities.\n  - As you may see, cities are filtered by country.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOh, Hartford, Frankfort.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nLooks like only.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nUS cities I think.\n  - Okay, so now you see it looks.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nLooks like.\n  - Well, okay, let's take another example.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNo country, you see all cities from different country.\n  - Ararat, Astrakhan, Baghdad, you see Bishkek, you see Bratislava.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nSo from different countries from.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOkay, so if you set some city.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\n--- Page 95 ---\n\nCountry will be populated automatically in this case.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBut if you clear country, city was cleared automatically.\n  - So if we provide some country like Bangladesh, you will see \nonly filtered cities.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nLet's go to our states.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nNow we have to search for Seattle.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nYes, you see it finds and filter works well.\n  - So this type of filtering can be.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nDone not only for citizen countries.\n  - For example, you can make two connected hookups.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOne is type of document and second one is for example subtype.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nAnd subtype should have a lookup column.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nReferencing to corresponding type.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\n--- Page 96 ---\n\nAnd in this case when user specifies type, it will be technically possible to.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nFilter subtypes according to selected type.\n  - But this canonic example with countries and cities, I think it's the easiest \nto.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nUnderstand examples so you can also use it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nDon't forget about business rules triggering by changing country.\n  - So save it.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nHave one more session tomorrow that will.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nBe dedicated to our client side.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nI plan to show you how to.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nMake details and also probably answer your questions if appear.\n  - If you ask something about some cases with \nprogramming inside of our pages in Freedom UI later we probably will also invest a bit of time into classic.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nUI examples and I think you'll be.\n  - --- Page 97 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nInterested in migration from Classic UI to Freedom ui.\n  - It will be only client side, so objects will be the same.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nThank you very much for your time.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nToday our session is over.\n  - In case.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nEnvironments, with your homework, tell me please.\n  - It's important for me to know.\n• Speaker 4\n  - # Speaker 4\n\nI have one.\n  - Did we go over.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou probably asked about something that you.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAlready saw in Classic UI with overriding of methods or this is something else.\n  - So can you explain the business \nexample?\n• Speaker 4\n  - # Speaker 4\n\n--- Page 98 ---\n\nNo, sorry, I just saw it on the list on.\n  - So you know you have the list of the breakdown of each day.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nOh, you mean this one?\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nThis is.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYeah, yeah.\n  - So this schedule is a bit outdated unfortunately.\n• Speaker 4\n  - # Speaker 4\n\nThat's it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt was possible in Classic ui, but it looks like fully not supported and not practical in Freedom ui.\n  - In Classic UI you \ncould rewrite or interfere into some life cycle stages of page by replacing its like critically important methods.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOwn methods, but system does not allow.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nYou to significantly change this life cycle.\n  - So it looks like I tried and.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nIt looks like when you have for.\n  - --- Page 99 ---\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nExample some handler and you already know that there is a base product handler which is declared somewhere in \nparent.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nTemplates, you cannot replace it with your own.\n  - Rejecting execution of all parent implementation.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nSo in Freedom UI you can write your own part and it will be.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nJust part of all the steps executed.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIn total and you can't break the way how pages code and what handlers are called there until you will write your own \ncontrol, I think so in Freedom UI we have different conditions for programming.\n  - I plan to update this program for.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nOur sessions and it's a bit outdated.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nHere, but I try to provide you the latest useful material and in the order which looks like the most, let's say natural.\n  - So \nwhen you do simple settings, then.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nYou do a bit more complex.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 100 ---\n\nAnd so our flow of real topics that we study, I think it's quite optimal for current version.\n• Speaker 4\n  - # Speaker 4\n\nThanks Mario.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nThank you Paddy for questions and any.\n• Speaker 2\n  - # Speaker 2\n\nAny, any difficulties with your Homework.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nWhen you do examples, when you make your sections, Maybe.\n  - Maybe you have something to say.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nIt happens that most of our participants watch videos like you now and then they decided to process video files \nmuch later than finishing of the sessions.\n  - So I recommend you to invest some time between the sessions to watch \nvideos and practice.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nSo at the end of the sessions next week, I will explain you some details how we will prepare for the exam, how it will \nbe organized and this is optional thing.\n  - So if you feel confident, you may apply for it.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\n--- Page 101 ---\n\nOr 50 minutes to get this video.\n• Speaker 3\n  - # Speaker 3\n\nThank you and goodbye.\n  - See you tomorrow.\n• Speaker 1\n  - # Speaker 1\n\nIt.\n\nKey Concepts: server, database, sql, data, package",
