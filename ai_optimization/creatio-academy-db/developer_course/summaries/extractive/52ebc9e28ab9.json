  "summary_text": "This setting was off by default and we must turn it on otherwise our break points will not work so this is critically important setting don't forget about this is important just my code was originally on it's recommended to keep it on but unfortunately edit and continue is not supported so we can shut it off and so we can turn it off it's not supported because compilation will be not done by visual studio will use the libraries created by creation and it's not good idea as visual studio tried to recompile them. File so it's possible and it's enough for debugging to open just file that we plan to debug let me show you no solution no project which is go to the integration tkg and we go to our package folder then we go to auto generated and find corresponding C sharp source of course we will not modify it we only open it Visual studio will create automatically generated solution but it's okay we can go to its inner code and put break point in order to stop execution of our code at this point at this part when we will finally run to this line. And what let me check process log it looks like something is going not is expected but it just took a bit longer time and yes we got our debugging no exceptions everything looks good we have just break point and execution stopped at the moment where we have script task in our business process. Stop your process at some step in order to investigate status parameters variables and so on you can add additional temporary items into your process that will display some data using any kind of first show message any kind of messaging like pre configured page or automatic auto generated page so you can use it for like artificial process stop and that's how you can get. This is quite efficient way of making your process interactive making your process able to input some complex data to display some intermediate or finishing results of calculation and all of this is possible thanks to user actions we only used pre configurate page we have a lot of other options here like dialogues open any page of existence section. And then object events first one is very easy this is no code solution and using business process start signals I will quickly made an example I will make an example for you you understand how it works to be very easy and very quick but it has also this advantage is it has only three supported events and relatively low speed but it's really fast today. So now you see auto add realty visits process and you see we have code and title great so the main idea of handling object events the help of start signal of course it's simply to turn our start simple event. Next time we will add two days then one day and then we will finish the process as you can see we can make simple cycles in business processes save it once I save it this process is already actual so I do not need to start it with a special button then I can go and check it again for example we have an apartment for it then we have no details okay and we can copy it. Where you spend the most of resources such things as duration can be really helpful to analyze overall performance so it was very easy simple example of handling object event with the help of start signal as you can see it doesn't take too much time so easy and fast to develop but we have quite simple three events and relatively low speed when I say about low speed you see point two second it means 200 millisecond for execution it's probably not so much but if you work with multiple records if your task is to process data with as fast as possible way so having such time spent on it probably will be not the perfect not the best idea so we have two more options of handling object events what of them require coding and second is object embedded process let me explain what it is about we will focus on objects now let's open so any object we can open any object and you can see its events tab events now you see 13 supported events so it's a lot we have 13 different options to handle events and once you start to use it for example before insert you see system generated some code we can copy it then we can look at open process button so it's important to mention that any creation object has its own unique individual embedded process this embedded process is designed only for one purpose only to handle object events the way how you can handle it includes using of events sub-process using its start message item and we have to paste our code that we initially copied from this into this then you can use items like script tasks formulas or user tasks and the most commonly script tasks are used and then you can connect your start message with this script task in this script task you can also operate with embedded so with your current entity with its data row you can use entity methods for it but there is a very strong disadvantage of using this approach in general and this is a advantage is quite serious this type of event handling does not work in packages compiled as separate as somebody simply speaking for all so for any modern package where this option is turned on in order to make fast compilation your event handling with embedded process will not work and it only works in old styled packages where you have no compiling into separate as somebody for example CRT base this package as far as I remember is not compiled as separate as somebody and we can look at its objects for example we can find the contact object one of the best examples contact it's not here let me find where it is placed for probably CRTDI let's check or maybe base something CRT core base package yes CRT core base this one contact object if we open it as you remember creator has open source for base product configuration we can see events we have some events settings here for our object and before insert after insert before delete after delete and then we can go to open process to see examples of implementing it so you see some examples of event sub-process start message then script task for execution of some useful logic and in many cases it's based on script tasks also you can see examples where we have some methods running and methods can be implemented in embedded process properties here and also as well as using of some additional using where we have my using it should be somewhere here I believe the run into oh using are here sorry quite all those so methods include decoration of the class fully and including methods that you need here and using can also typed manual if you want but this stuff works only in this package because we have CRT core base package which is not compiled separately but if you want to develop such code if you want to compile it you will experience quite big delays so in general use of packages not compiled a separate assembly will make it hard for you because long compilation time and you may ask me about okay so if this powerful tool with 13 supported event does not work so how we can use it how we can handle object events efficiently and supporting all modern package features the answer is third answer is object events layer the most say the most modern and like the most recommended way to handle object event it also still needs coding so it means we will have a compiled code and it has a bit less events only eight supported events but it is the most flexible and I will explain why so now you will see this example we need some documentation for this this is about backend server site data operations and I need to find object events yes some here somewhere here great this is our article that you need to study if you want to understand better how this mechanism works we have eight supported events and they definition is before and after insert before and after update before and after delete and also we have very interesting and unusual event called saving before and after save but what is save it's interesting that save was used in order to make the same handler if you want to organize the same logic for adding data and for updating data record so saving is triggered in case of insert and in case of update and here I can see the exact order of execution saving inserting then actual add of data is performed in database then insert to do and save it so that's how order of execution events is performed. Sada tells that has to leave and will be finished to later thank you very much Sada sorry for making my sessions a bit longer than expected possibly we had to plan it to run for 2.5 hours okay Sada thank you very much for your time have a good have a good Tuesday thank you so here we have a set of events for creating record set of events for updating and obviously for delete thank you so 8 supported events and I told you that it's very flexible so why it is flexible I will try to explain in previous examples we had to create a process which starts by signals or we had to make changes in object if you want to add some event handling but in this case in this third way of event handling I call it object events layer or object events or entity events so in this in this approach we can create our own class which will not require any changes of the object that we plan to listen so we will just specify object code and that will be enough for our class to operate normally so we can listen any existence system object no matter how far it is developed inside of our package hierarchy this approach does not care about package dependencies at all the only condition for it to work is presence of corresponding object at our environment and this is a C sharp code that can be designed with the help of special item called C sharp source code so we will use this tool we will use professional integration with visual studio and I will show you how we can make event handling of it it will not take too much time for those of you who do not really like to program in C sharp this will be a bit boring but I will try to make sure that you can see it fast and you will see business results right now and it's important to mention that this kind of event handling will be performed as well at server site so no matter how technically this insert will happen like we add data from user interface page or we add data with the help of business process or we add data with the help of API calls processing it at server site will trigger this event handling so this event handling is inevitable for server site and there is no way how you can suppress such event processing so it's quite reliable and that's why it is suitable tool performed server site validation let me explain some business sense of it let's imagine our task is to make some limitation on data and for example we will have a very big price for our reality and we will put some very immense number here so it's not correct too much yeah you see we have some limitation here okay what about this okay looks good so here is our commission our huge price with 9000 to 3 don't so okay very big price and system still allows us to save it so we want to limit this value we want to make some server site limitation and we don't want to save such big prices in our system because it's obviously stick so I will show you how to make server site validation with the help of entity events let's go so according to the manual but I did not share the link with you object business process oh I really share okay so according to the manual we have to make a C sharp source code and implement this kind of text there so let's do this select our package and source code this is a special type of item which is designed to provide a pure source of a C sharp which we can develop inside of creation or we can create it separately using powerful external editors but creating of C sharp source should be done from this editor Adrian is asking when do we use server site validation instead of client site oh this is a great question Adrian so server site validation is much more reliable because client site validation is only working when you operate with the page so you remember our client site validation does not allow us to put negative prices like this so it will not allow us to save it but it can be easily bypassed so for example you can make a business process which will do this or we can make a hack now trying to edit data in our list utilizing our editable list features and when you see that if we have no any event handling and we did not care about the handling by the way we don't have any no code options so far to make a custom handling of a list edit events so now you see we easily bypassed this so I just wanted to say that client site validation is good but it's not perfect you can use bypass with a list edit you can use a bit more complicated approach with business process which you can run and it will not follow client validation or even more you can use api call to insert new data and it will also do not use client site validation so client site is not reliable this is only for page and it's limited on the page so if data comes some other way not from your page so your validation will not work if you do it in client site server site is much more reliable it will work any time when entity data model is used no matter if it's used from UI from api call from a business process so it will work any time when you use data model so let's go back to our C sharp sources we have to create it I selected the package add the C sharp source code and that's how I get this tab it makes sense to provide better friendly name here let's say it will be named us are a reality events so my code for this configurable item will be real events and two ways to compose a different title so I will make the same title the same title because it's technical thing no one will be selecting it from any list so let it be my package no description because I'm lazy again and we have this this example now you see all we have here is list so just small set of properties and no localizable string and here we will have C sharp code here of course we can type it in this editor but it's not so powerful not so quick and it will not display highlight some errors syntax and other stuff so I will show you powerful integration with the show studio if you work on local on site environment of course if you work in cloud conditions you will have to type your code here and rack is asking oh I have to leave okay thank you Raki I will finish probably in 10 minutes so it's not so hard thank you for your time you will watch videos so I will show you how to integrate it with visual studio because it's much more efficient than typing your code manually here so we can save our new created source code schema source code item into our package physically it saves it on disk so we can see it on disk and of course we can also see it in our configuration in our package this is our new item this is a fully server site feature so it includes C sharp code and it's necessary to compile if you want to see how it works let's go to file system and check it out let go to our package then go to schema and then we have to find realty events that's why having a friendly name is important because it will be good to look at our disk and also at our version control so here we see some bit of metadata we do not care about it too much but a realty events CS file it's a pure C sharp code that we can develop into that we can develop with the visuals studio so let me show you how to use visual studio for this we still have to run it as a administrator if you want to debug you can close reduce open files probably we can close automatically generated solution closed solution so no solutions we throw then we'll show you how we can use visual studio for efficient development I also need to show you some file system settings that we have thanks to creation so inside of a package folder we have files and we have CS project file this project file was generated by creation it has several sections of libraries with references which makes it possible to add the custom libraries if you want to include them into this project but the most important is that this CS project file is used to get your compiled library of your package so what you need to know that all necessary for your visual studio to run and to work with your code is already created by creation by its own so I will use visual studio file open project then I have to carefully select corresponding folder as you can see my previous open projects were in D5 I wrote a D1 the map there's a configuration pkg then I will find my real team folder for my package files and then I have to open this C sharp project file CS project open it studio will think for a couple of seconds but it will be still very quick and if you want to do the same with a package which is not compiled or separate assembly you have to look at special part in the result configuration SLN solution this is a very big solution includes more than several thousands of C sharp files so it will take a couple of minutes for visual studio to digest all of its sources to understand everything all the references and it will be possible for you to use it for development of C sharp sources in case if you operate with the package that is not compiled is separate assembly but in our case luckily we use this option and that's why opening this project is quite easy and quick thing so if you can find this C sharp file C sharp code of course I already created an example to not take too much time entity event listener so my code is ready I only have to copy it for you into chat you'll be able to download chat messages I want with video files and I will use the same code into my own I need to tell you that here we have full features traditionally supported by visual studio like IntelliSense using example like this you see in Auto IntelliSense you see Auto Complete you see System Highlights text and you see that when I type something with mistakes it will immediately show error messages it will show that we have something wrong in our text it will highlight this text and tell us that we have something missing so this is quite powerful editor with IntelliSense and Auto Complete we have to perform a class with a couple of usings and inside of some namespace there is a tradition to keep your configuration code into TerraSoft configuration namespace but in general you can decide yourself and you can create and support your own namespaces if you want so here we have TerraSoft configuration just because of tradition using some system namespaces and what is the most important here is how we declare our class this class for listening of object events must be inherited from the identity event listener and also this class must be decorated with entity event listener C sharp attribute special part of C sharp code which sets additional properties to our class and this property includes schema name, the parameter that's how system will understand what exact object you plan to listen so this line number seven is very important because it shows what object we plan to listen very important we can easily make a mistake here if we do then nothing will happen and we will have no listening at all you have to specify name of existing object here okay then we have from one to eight supported methods that are virtual all the reading methods of a base class so we have to make public override void and then provide corresponding method name we have article explaining all supported methods here you can see and in my case I plan to make it a bit more interesting and useful so I plan to use on saving event which will work in case of insert and in case of update this is an in the event saving it will happen before insert and before update of record according to our documentation we have some arguments here and for before events we have reference to our data record which is an instance of an entity class and also we have some before arguments such arguments are quite interesting and important we can check out what are the values there and you will see that inside of traditional properties we have is validation enabled Boolean property key value which is ID of selected record which is currently being processed and also we have is cancelled property which helps to organize graceful reject of executing of our event and if you want to make it gracefully without any notes for end user you can just enable is cancelled true and your event will not happen but this approach has a disadvantage and this silence which user will notice probably is not self explanatory for the color side so for example if user tries to add new data and provides two big price then system says okay no error messages but when user will start to check it will turn out that corresponding record was not inserted or updated so this silence sometimes is not so desired and we can make our operation with some noise and it will be quite rude loud noise with throwing exception so we can compose message text and put some data there and then throw an exception to make our message code dependent from language we can use localizable strings so let's save our code and we need to use localizable strings here this will be also example for you and then we can go back to Cishap source code we already saved our code open it from embedded editor and we can create localizable strings and our code is values too big we use this localizable code and our localizable text message is here prices more than certain limit are not allowed this text helps us to get localizable string from properties of this schema then we use string format to replace some pattern with a certain number with a certain string and then we show this message for user as result this throwing exception will finally make an error 500 at server side so it will be internal server error that's why I say it's quite loud and rude behavior but it works so it's very practical for our case user tries to do something gets error message gets error text and everything is quite clear and user will see that operation was not done and there is a reason why it failed so we will see this error message just a second so we can save our Cishap source code we did not change any line here with embedded editor and as you can see it works well so we can use the same item with internal editor or you can use the same item with external editor to ask us to reload so we can reload it we can save it no problem as you can see it's up to you how you can how you prefer to work with it so finally we must make sure that everything was saved and then we go back to our application and start to compile our code we can compile our package the first time we have to manually do this our package and compile action the compilation takes some time and the first time probably it will take maybe 30 or 40 seconds next time for the same package it may take just 10 or 20 seconds so it's quite good performance and it will be way way faster than compile all of your system so now you can see it probably took 30 or 40 seconds to compile and it finished with no mistakes no errors and you see that this configuration finished there was no errors and we can check how it works once we created and successfully compiled such Cishap source code it automatically becomes active and will work with any kind of insert let's try to copy this big price as one more time data let's say two so we have definitely greater than one billion so our logic our comparison condition here checks I did not explain how it works actually so sender is an argument object we can run some parent implementation of the same handler if necessary if present then we can turn our sender into entity this is important to make possible running of entity methods for our data argument then we try to get price value our column is named usr price usd let me check to make sure that it's correct real t yes it's correct no problem so it's correct operation to read price then if price is greater than one billion we do throw in messages if not greater than it's okay we do nothing so it works like server side validation for us and now I expect that system will not show me so it will show me some error message now you can also enable browser developer console control shift i in order to make so and go to network tab in order to see all text or requests that will happen here so this value is definitely greater than one billion so let's try to create new network now you see that insert failed writes is more than one billion are not allowed and you see that insert query finally finished with error 500 internal server error quite rude mistake from a server side when you perform your business logic so it's like a crash but it's okay it's effective crash for us we see some response we see error message it's quite obvious and client side also was capable to handle such error and when you try to do this as you can see we see error message everything is quite obvious that something is wrong so we can fix our data let's make it not so big like this when we save it it's okay and you see that insert query now executed successfully we have no troubles we have the data at our database and everything looks quite well for us existing data will be not we'll be not so we can try to update it okay let's try to update it with an edit page so like slightly less clear say we still have troubles prices cannot be allowed okay cancel close now let's make trick make an update using list like this clear try to say as you can see still favor because it's server side server side is efficient and you see we still have error message we have error description prices are not allowed so you see we can cancel such attempt only if we will edit it in a value that is below our limit then we can save it and update or work normally data is processed normally and it works efficiently the same business logic will work in case if insert is performed from business process or if insert is performed with the help of API calls we will study API calls and integration techniques a bit later you will see the abilities for it and we will check again that this validation is quite reliable and works for any kind of insert or update attempts okay that was the third option for our event handling so we already finished with the creating examples of handling events and if you have any questions for today please ask me I will finalize my today sessions save everything to file system because we had changes at our localizable strings business processes so save everything and then committed to version control thank you very much for your time our session is over in case if you have any questions feel free to ask you will receive video recording as usual so our sessions over thank you very much see you tomorrow and goodbye you",
