And when this \nprocess item start, according to this mapping, SQL text will load data from SQL text parameter and average price \nUSD will load data from corresponding average price process parameter. # Speaker 1\n\nUser can easily go back to the process by looking at notification panel business process tasks show corresponding \npage, save it and that's how the page will be fixed. # Speaker 1\n\nIf you run your process with no background option, it means that from user point of view, insert or update will take \nsome time plus time for running of your process because it will Be started at the same scope at the same thread. It's if you set run following elements in \nthe background physically system performs scheduling of your process according to insert event into one time \nexecution with the help of background process scheduler and it will finally start in a separate thread. Okay, parent reality, we can take it from start signal so we can take it from process \nparameters switching to process elements reality added and then double click on unique identifier. So for any modern package \nwhere this option is turned on in order to make fast compilation, your event handling with embedded process will not \nwork.",
