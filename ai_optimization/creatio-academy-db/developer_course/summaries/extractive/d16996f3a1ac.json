  "summary_text": "So, our main entity is a single record and then we need to keep information for example about different types of addresses for our customer or different emails or maybe it's a simple list of context connected to this account. And so, details they are usually connected with main entity with the help of lookups, look up columns and each detail record has information about its parent account and that's how system can filter through all addresses and show only addresses related to this currently selected data record. So let's go to our configuration section, select our package where we will work on, maybe we'll focus on objects first and we will create manually create new object. The default value will be provided in case if you try to add the new record, and it makes sense especially if you want to change for example till tomorrow but having similar time setting automatically value here will be quite good. So developers also realized that if we have no such option and let's imagine we have probably a solid end of out of the box objects for our big base product like sale service and marketing. Each time you try to make any changes in these tables such foreign keys will be invalidated and they will be checked and it will be a huge performance impact on on your database in each time you do some operations like in search updates such foreign keys are also checked and the contact table will take a huge time for blocks that is necessary to perform low level database checks for work of foreign keys. So developers decided to sacrifice referential integrity here and that's why they decided to make it with no foreign keys for created by and for modified by and such behavior was inherited from base look up or sorry from base entity if you will search for a base entity in our packages open it you will find out that this column created by has option do not control integrity and modified by also has this option do not control integrity. So this is made intentionally and because of performance so maybe something like interest in fact you may need this option in very rare cases when you create some artificial look ups based on something that is not a table like something that is a database view or even something more weird weird thing like a programmed stuff at the server side not a database item at all in this case do not control integrity will save you because otherwise system will fail to save your object where it can't find physical database that you point on selecting your look up data source. Okay what else probably we need one more column here this is comment let's make a text to 100 and comment sorry yep fighter will be comment so any visit may end out with something like we need to remember to write down and just to have some notes maybe some decisions maybe some ideas so comment after a visit could be really helpful if you want to proceed with this reality so we can have a comment as a text field very simple not required and just text value okay so now it looks like our simple detail object is almost ready and we have to save and publish it clicking publish as you remember will automatically perform save first now you see it and then it will do publish operation and it also takes a couple of seconds great our object is ready but what we need to do and what is a bit different from maybe you have some experiences older UI and maybe you have some previous creation experience so starting from version 8 objects are connected with page object connected with pages with a separate special setting inside of objects properties so now you can see pages tab and we have to specify edit page for our real to visit obviously we don't have any page for this so we can easily create with the add new page button we can create new edit page for our detail we can specify select some parent template that will be used as a basis for our page our column set is not so big and impressive so we can just take some mini page example which will also look good if you have not so many columns so I will select mini page and this mini page offers us possibilities okay we can use some code let's say let's put some good looking code like real to visit page title we have to visit page okay maybe we can call it form page just to make it traditional with a real T form page so real to visit form page its parent package is real to template is mini page great now we have to use existing columns as you can see we can add new columns but we already have data attributes already designed in our objects so we can just show it up so what we need here is visit date and time probably the first important column that we need to display second important column is attention customer and third one will be comment okay so you may ask me and what about parent reality it's mandatory why don't we show it here the answer is that in case of the tail management when we add the new data from the main edit page from main real T page our parent reality will be already known and we should not allow to change it for user and we should probably should not even show it for user so we can hide this column so we cannot show it on the page and in case of creating a record for detail or in case of updating new record or updating existing record or editing record in all the scenarios we can set parent reality automatically so we may not allow our user to change reference to a parent reality of an existing visit and that's why I will not show this column for user at all so it will be just hidden it will be not shown on the page and our reality visit page will look like this we can see it. Why you stir red asterix besides visit date and time and parent reality it's a mean it means the column is required system will not allow us to save data if required column is empty okay and for parent reality we will guarantee that it will be filled incorrectly so even if it's required we will make take care about setting it properly in all possible scenarios so we don't need to show it in edit page we can show it and probably make it locked just to display and demonstrate that this visit is connected to some parent reality but we will always look at this page from reality main main page so maybe it's not necessary this is very common for details and creation to hide parent column from the page at all so we can save now page now so save it fully no business rows no code and no any special settings so try to keep it as simple as possible and when we did it so we can find this page in this list so it's search for something connected to visits reality visit form page the full page here means that it will be used for all scenarios to add to browse to edit data so it will be used for all scenarios and you can see it's possible to make a separate add record window in case if we need to do it in a very specific way for example when you add data you have to specify one set of columns when you edit you want to specify totally another set of columns it could be used and also we have an option for different pages depending on some specific field value this can be helpful in case if your entity is quite big and complex we have examples of such big complex entities in creation and one of them is activity and the person I don't really like this but it turned out that activity is used for calls for emails for meetings for to do tasks which you can create for yourself so you can see a bit of a different nature for the same entity so you have one single section and many different purposes in it obviously for email we will have a different edit page then for a call and a different set of columns different display and different page design and that's why we have this option multiple pages based on specific field value so for example activity entity has a field value category which shows us is it an email or a call or a meeting and depending on this column we can use different pages and when you look at activity section for example you select an email try to open its page based on this information system will show you email edit page if you do the same for a call it will open your call edit page for activity but now I try to keep it simple so we will have just one single page for all possible visits because we do it and we just need to get used to it be details in general we need to understand them well so we have this option this is mandatory okay finally we finished and we can publish our object again as you can see we have to do it twice first to create it second to analyze assigning over page for for the object okay great now our object is ready we can close it now we can see that in our package two items appear it so we have a realty visit page we have object for realty visits you can find some additional strange items called add-ons and sometimes you have add-ons for pages and we can find add-ons for objects add-ons are separately saved pieces of metadata you can try to open them but you will see redone text in JSON which represents metadata we have some a bit more user friendly way to read it you see read only way and you can see property names but in general this is only make sense to base core creation developers who wants to check if everything is okay with metadata or not in projects development and the end user customization add-on is just something that is saved in addition for the page or object so we don't need to modify it attempt to modify we should not remove it from the system where it be so it's just a separate stored stuff connected to his page or an object good so now we have our object and it's time to think how we can put it to our page and display corresponding data so we can do this with the help of edit page button as you can see it's my favorite way to customize your system and other options we have another options like finding your corresponding form page and open it from configuration section to be the same result or you can achieve the same result if you go to this setting page, physical it's system designer then you find application hub then you find your realty application switch the pages and find form page so this same way for opening no no no not visit a realty form page the same way to open the same page editor and the i-person referred to do it from section because it makes less chance to make mistake and when you click on this you'll always open corresponding page and you should not focus on its name in the list of pages okay so we opened our editor to design our page our task is to display details and details are usually displayed with the items called list or expanded list i prefer to use expanded list and this is very traditional for creation because expanded list means you can collapse it and it will take less space if it's not necessary or you can expand it that's why it's called expanded i would say it's expandable when it's necessary to see some data from it so let's use this expanded list component carefully drag and drop it on our page i will use just free space in the bottom of this tab but it's also possible to use additional tabs if you want to you can organize your data stored in different tabs it's up to you so here we have expanded list and a shell part of it includes only settings like buttons and the title and so on and inner part of it represents data data list of course we have to specify object first and as you probably guess we have to find our reality visit object or our detail it immediately shows us set of columns so possibly we have to take care of set of columns and i would like to show here first to update and time potential customer maybe comment then create it on column maybe just for reference i would also display parent reality then i can hide the unnecessary columns and now you see how we should display our data we can carefully shrink some columns okay as you can see in freedom UI system offers us horizontal scroll so we can add unlimited number of columns we can flexibly design their weeds and the horizontal scroll will show us and the classic UI does not allow to build this and there is no horizontal scrolls in classic UI and only 24 available columns to be displayed so freedom UI is more flexible here okay so we have this list of data but what we need to know how did you have the columns again i just missed it this was at the columns and then you can select please note the order of how you click here matters so if you click here here and here you will see the same columns in corresponding order selected at your list i first clicked on visit date then potential customer then comment in the same order columns appear here and you can specify such columns in order to provide default column setup for your detail it will be nice for your users to see your detail with some preset columns so they will easily understand what it is about and if it has some data they will also see corresponding data and they will see what they expect so here is our list but also we need to do some additional settings in the right part this is detail and detail must show us data only connected to its main entity record only for currently selected reality and not any other reality so we have to make some filtering of page data as you can see this information tells us about that we may use it for example for detail filtering so let's click on this plus and we have to construct simple filter which will we have applied for all the data which you plan to see in this list this simple filter is based on one condition some column from reality object must be matched with realty visit in realty visit we have suitable column parent reality and system is smart enough to detect that you should use id for main record this so here you see this filter by page data will be based on id of reality and it must be equal to realty visit parent reality that's how we will filter our data and show only visits for corresponding house not for any other another house okay this filter is mandatory so you must do this otherwise you will constantly see a big set of visits not related to your selected apartment for example no need to use static filters but if you want you can apply there and we have some options like row numbering multi selection allowed in line editing in line insert okay I can forbid the in line insert and we will only use plus button to add new data we can also program bulk actions for list so when you operate with a list it's possible to select multiple records and then we have bulk actions for example you can program additional actions here and that's how you can do some customization and the additional function that will be running for selected data they are called bulk actions bulk here means that you can select several records and then perform one single action for such records in order to so to process data more efficient okay so we have element code here and it looks like our main list part is already set all we have to do now is to find the small plus button this plus button is designed to add new data to the detail of course it action will be open you record it will be new real to visit object and system will find its page automatically but here we have importance adding which column values to set and I told you when we create new the tail data we must take care about parent reality value so we have to set here some default value for parent reality parent reality will have its default value we have not so many options here so value from another field and we will have parent reality id that's the only thing which is suitable here so when anyone clicks on the plus new reality visit page will appear but parent reality for this data record will be already set up as id of our reality this is very important otherwise we will not be able to normally create visits so please remember this is filling of a column that is used for connection between visits and our real okay great know any additional settings so you just have to remember when you build your detail you should set up your list and then take care about plus button that's all we can save our changes and test our our detail works we need to reload page just to make sure we are not fighting with any kind of browser cache issue well let's go to apartment in new ornins now you see our detail by the way it's interesting these stages of expanded or collapsed system remembers it and it remembers it separately for each user so if I prefer not to work with this tail I can collapse it and system will forever remember it if necessary I can expand it if other users prefer to expand it they also may use this management and they can collapse or expand only necessary tails so let's make a quick test of how our detail works let's try to add new record you see default value of a visit date and time was set okay it's set 8 for tomorrow the same time probably we do not know any potential customers so where it be James Bond here is some trick if you will click on this hyperlink it will open corresponding contact page so it's not what you plan when we select data it's better to click on the record but not on the hyperlink so somewhere here double click that's how we will select data in this comment and comment some test comment save it you see the data was created and parent reality was automatically set correctly we can copy this data save it check it out you see the parent reality is copyable it's very important to keep it copyable so in this case creating a new record was correctly copied preuse parent reality and obviously we can do it one more copy we can edit any record by double click on it or by click and open and obviously we can remove data if not if not needed so our detail looks very good and works correctly let's check that for other reality records we don't have this data so let's go to select and find another reality oh we have something interesting here let's check out you see our page is hanging now probably it's because of browser issue I just through I just updated it recently so possibly we have some kind of browser browser related issue and also we can close all unnecessary pages maybe to help our system to work more correctly something unusual happens with my browser with my app so let's check about its CPU and memory and I will reload the page fully this is not a result of adding details so it's probably some kind of crash but not related to our detail data so now you can see our apartments and visits for apartments were done okay another house in Miami another data so we have no data let's make for a house in Miami some visit next month we don't know who exactly will come and we can save this planned visit so depending on the record you see corresponding detail values at our visits you see okay great so now we successfully made our detail of course we have to take care about saving everything on disk we have to submit our changes to version control just to finalize this step of our settings so we can like more confidently move on without a fraying without being afraid of something can be lost in the middle so I recommend you to do such commits in version control because it helps to keep all your history and also if something happens with your environment having such history will be a great help because you'll be able to recover anything that you develop so in my case now everything was saved let's commit it to version control we have some data here we have a lot of items modified it looks like our section was never submitted to version control so it means like real T app added visits detail added okay so it will be a quite big commit for us and we will sync changes which means pull and push to common repository and now it's okay it's done so we can track our changes at our GitHub repository seven commits you can see all the history you see how many files were changed and so on each time we do this you'll be able to track all the history and make control over what is going on here okay so what's next what we can do next with our details and with our pages you can program something in edit page of a detail with the same with the same way how we did programming in our big form page so this is this page is reduced as you can see we have a button for edit page we also be able to do programming of its handlers or validation so rules are the same and also you can use business rules if you want to do some kind of filtering or simple fields hiding or showing you can use all the features so you should remember that our page for detail is based on a separate client module that was created today it was a reality visit page so this reality visit form page as you can see it's a separate client module we can even look at its code if interested it has its own view config view model model config and empty handlers validators and converters maybe you have any questions maybe you have some like notes ideas or something and in some implementations you may need to create a redone details in this case you may hide new button you may construct your object which will have no edit page at all and you may also disable editing in list so inline edit should be disabled so redone details make sense when you have some data automatically calculated for it and such data is not expected to be added or modified by end user redone details are helpful especially if you use some kind of integration with therapeutic systems and you can read data from third party data sources using for example some database to database connection if it's on site and then display such data as a list in your pages okay so that's how you may do such details and you may organize them in separate tabs of your page or you can put it down there is no physical limit on how long you can scroll down so you can put new items down this page and there are no limitations of number of rows let's try to move on and possibly before we move on and work with classic UI I need to show you something important related to customization of existing pages and also important things about customization of about managing your applications so let me explain what I plan to do right now let's imagine this is very typical by the way this is a very common scenario let's imagine your business user asks you and says hey you know you already created your own sections it's very good we do this for example we have a real to section we keep some data there it's okay but also inside of our customizations we need to do some changes at existing entities for example we have accounts which represent a list of companies and we want to connect such accounts with some kind of third party website where we have a list of our customers and we need to make some connections with it so we need one more extra column at our accounts section and simply speaking we need to add some columns into existing entities we can do this easily with no code approach let me show you how it's possible to do you can open account page account form page and then you can go and click on this edit page button let's try to do this let's see what happens as we're running our system as administrators so our supervisor user is a member of system administrators role now you can see account page design and you may now see some very strange package automatically created and system does not allow us change it and this strange package will be used so it will be created by system automatically and when we customize something system will save our changes into this package okay let's agree let's allow it to do this so let's agree for this procedure so our task is to add the one more column to the account so we will have a text value let's put it somewhere here we can name our new column website code we can also provide its code for it website code copy sorry confirm text 200 grade editable grade element code should be unique okay where it be uh developer friendly so we made our new column this is very typical we did not use programming at all this is only customization but you need to know how technically this is done and where it will be finally saved and how to for example turn your system back to its pre-do step pre-do stage if you realize that such change was not designed was not desired anymore so when you change by like this you can save it also you can hide existing columns of course in this case they will be not removed you can move some columns you can reorganize user page of existing section it's also allowed to do you can also add a lot of new components on the page not connect to database at all so it's up to you how you do this customization in my case i try to keep it very simple i just added one single column here okay and then we save it now i should pay your at so let attract your attention that we will finally receive new package our customization will be saved as a special type of item into this new package so let's try to do this and then let's see what final level happen this is a fully valid flow valid algorithm how to customize existing tools you could also customize it the same by going to application hub finding customer 360 app and then making changes for a page from there okay so we made our new column let's close the page here open it again probably we already will see it yeah website code you can test some value here as you can see it was correctly it was correctly saved now let's save it some warnings but close maybe let's hide some unnecessary columns in order to display important for us columns website code yes it saved correctly everything is good we can even edit in line edit it we can even do like this and save our changes so then open it you see everything works just as planned so we managed to create new column it is displayed in our accounts section everything looks good now let's go to configuration section or maybe it's better to go here to application hub because it will be more clear for you to see let's go to customer 360 app because our account edit page originated from this section so it was designed in this section let's open it now we see some checks some some items our pages seems not to be changed so we have the same set of pages as from out of the box but when we look at number of our packages we will see all three standard packages but they are idonly and once we need to save some customizations system created automatically new package with this strange name and it created several items for it and such items are not so easy let me show you properties we have special type of object which is called replacing object it's not usual object this is replacing object and also we have special type of item which is called replacing client module you can see replace parent option is on and this is extremely important for you to understand and feel this difference so now we are going very close to understand what is replacing object and why it is different from regular object and what is replacing view model or simply speaking replacing client module from any previously known and studied types of client modules possibly it's make it's better to start from objects here so what is replacing object let's open it maybe we'll understand it better when we open it first of all it's interesting that replace replace an object it has replace parent option on which clearly states that this is not a usual regular object the place in object is used when your original object is present and your task is to customize it but original object is not in your package and the original package is not editable in our case account entity was designed somewhere in base product creation packages it was additionally customized in customer 360 packages but they are it only if you want to change and save something we have to use replace an object and save it into our packaging to new package this package now is editable it's very important also it's very important that in replace an object parent object is mandatory and now you see value here parent object is account and replace an object code is absolutely the same this is important rule of creation architecture so when you replace some entity its name remains the same you can change its title moreover it was used in base platform bank software products where original account was replaced and sorry it was renamed with another name called legal entity but physically it was still account entity and it's still the same table and the same logical name at program code so only title was changed so when you replace some entity you can change its title but you cannot change its code okay and the code should be remaining the same and personally I would like to make it not editable as you can see here this editor offers us the possibility to change its code but physically system will not allow us to save it and it will show us big red messages when you try to save such changes so I think that this editor should not allow you to modify code in case if you work with replace an object okay so code must be the same as original one what we have as replacement we have a lot of inherited columns all the columns from original entity are shown here we can slightly change them we can change the title we can modify their default value or make it required or not required but we will not be able to rename original column we will not be able to change its look-up property and in general it's not recommended to change its type even though system offers us such possibility to change the type in its subtype range for example if original type was text 200 then potentially you can extend it to text 500 but I do not recommend you to do this because you will face some additional unexpected difficulties so it's possible but I think not so feasible so it's better not to touch types of columns when you make replacing objects so the main reason why you need replacing object of course is creating your own columns like we did here so this is our own new custom column website code and actually this website code is saved into our replace an object all inherited columns are obtained from parent entity so we cannot remove inherited columns and we cannot edit any property so we cannot rename inherited columns we cannot change its title our custom columns are shown here in columns list and usually the reason why developers create replacing objects is need to add your own columns sometimes replacing object is created because you want to change some common properties like title of the object like some behavior settings or maybe change of access rights settings when you replace an object you can modify access rights behavior change and we have three types of access rights permissions related to objects in creation access rights set for general operations to allow or disable selection insert update or delete operation for the object in total we have a record level access rights whereas some records can be editable and others will be protected and will be redonely and some other records maybe will be only hidden and shown only for developers and also for some rearchages you can also use column level protection of data where some columns are shown and other columns are hidden and other columns redone link so three levels of access rights protection and when you make a replacing object you can also change such permission set okay so the main reasons generally we have two reasons of using replacing object making your own columns or customizing and changing some properties of existing what is also important for you to know is that replacing object is saved into your own package and it represents some changes that you add into existing structure of your entity this can be done you can see it clearly if you go to configuration section let me explain let's go to all packages search for objects and look for account object and make it strictly searched by equals condition so only if object name equals to account it will be shown here now you can see we have some origin of it origin of account is somewhere in city core base if we open its properties we will see that it was inherited from bezentity based object it's the same bez object is title bezentity it's code and this is not a replacement so no replacement so this was original creating of new entity named account but then after creating it in CLT core base package we had several reasons to do changes in completeness package in email mining package and in some other packages including this weird package related to customers 360 app that made recently so you should understand that we have original structure of the account entity and then we have some add-ons added to it finally our last edition will be from our customer so from our editable package and it will be like a final layer of all the settings as you may guess the order of application of such layers is important because if this one is applied later than ours so this one will declare final values of certain properties that we need so the order of applying of changes is really really important and usually this order follows package dependencies diagram so if our package is somewhere at the bottom of this structure our changes will be added the last and it will be no problem for us to specify final properties of our object for example disable some access restrictions or change some column titles final structure of account is formed by its origin plus all the replacements it's interesting to mention that at the database level we have just only one data table let me show you this is our set of databases d1 database which we work on now we have account data table we can extend it see its set of columns now you see for account table we have a lot of base product columns and the last one is our website code that we added recently so replacement object does not create any new table replacing object uses existing table and adds new columns there if you will remove replacing object from your system logically your new column will disappear physically it will be present in the database as a kind of leftover but it will be not so critical not so important and I think that end user will not notice it at all if you recover your package again you will still to select this column logically and it will be available at application so that's how the replacing object works and you can use it to customize any existing part of creation objects including some base objects like base entity and base so you can customize quite flexibly even some let's say top level objects that are used for many of inherited to child items so you can use replacement for any existing object and the adrian is asking very interesting question which I plan to move on here so you work with some account page and you would like to keep your settings saved in a proper place yes adrian I will show you now and I'm just going probably not so fast with explanations here so now we have customer c60 app and for this app system created editable package and we have some contents in this editable package we have some customizations made especially for this app let's imagine that you have more apps like you have sales automation app when you add so for example you have case management app it's a base product for service automation you have some lead generation some opportunity management so let's imagine you have several apps and you want to customize most of them by default system will create separate editable package for each scenario for each case when you want to customize some existing app but obviously you may not want to work with such many packages also you may not want to work with packages with ugly names let me explain what I'm talking about let's reload our data go to all items and now you see package with some ugly name usr-crt-customer-app and then some strange unique suffix added to it so it's the same the same name will appear on our discord more probably already appeared let me check it out so I expected to see here yes the same strange name appeared on our disk very soon this name will travel to version control and it will be not so comfortable for other developers to see such a strange package so your question and Adrian question is asking about is it possible to use your own package instead of such ugly stuff that was created by system and the answer is yes we can manage this this is not obvious and you have to perform additional steps to enable such management so let me show you how you should do this let's go to lookups or we can go to studio lookups okay and then let's search for recently added lookups first sorting by date of creation okay then we can register special object as a lookup this object is named something like package just yes this name is package in installed application and this is quite not obvious I only knew this from my colleagues so this is kind of a technological secret and I think it's not very easy to find but if you know that it exists so you will enable it of course package in installed application and we will provide the same name for our lookup and try to save it okay this is only developer tool so we do not need to transport such registering of package to test and production we can open contents and now you will see all installed applications all existing packages and you will see settings for all packages are they primary for certain app and are they used as a default current package current package means a digital package that is used to save new customization so let me show you how we can do some tricks now we have customer 360 app and we have this strange package is used as a primary and current package for this app so any new customization that we do in customers to 60 will fall into this package we don't really want this so we want probably to remove this package at all and maybe we would like to use our existing new package which is a dev package we have it dev classic package so we would like to use dev classic package for this so we can try to do this replacement instead of this we can clear and then search or maybe just type dev dev classic package so we can put our existing package as a target default package for customers 60 customizations and confirm our decision of course we will have to take care about package dependencies now our dev classic package has no dependencies but it will appear so it will receive it soon let's go to our application hub now try to customize customers 360 go to advanced settings and now you see our dev classic package is connected to this app and we can see properties of this package let's check what about dependencies you see that system automatically added customers to 60 app as a parent dependency to this package when we made changes when we customized this stuff so we did something like this oh something like this yeah so we did this setting and it was important so now we have automatic changes in package dependencies okay great so you can see dev classic is connected to this app and probably the last step that we will need to do is we have some customization made in this ugly package and we can transport it to our dev classic because we don't want to use this package at all we want to get rid of it and we will continue customization of customers 360 in our classic package and Drian is it what you were asking for okay great thank you Adrien so now we have multi action move to another package you should be mentally ready that this movement takes significant time because system performs a lot of checks and sometimes it fails because we miss dependencies or some other technical reasons but in general it's quite safe too so you will probably run it fully correctly if everything is okay with dependencies of target package so now I'm trying to remove items created in my ugly package into dev classic then I will I plan to remove my ugly package at all from my system it will be empty and I can safely remove it as you can see this transfer takes significant time because it looks like system performs a lot of checks of items that we process and it makes sure that we have no other connections to this item so it does something very probably some excessive work but okay it makes it successful and now you see our customization travel to this dev classic package now if you go here you see our customization should be present here probably it's because of caching so let's reward yes now it's here this information probably will let's rule this part oh it still remembers of this connection so we can remove now this package and this line also will be disappeared let's let me show you so this ugly package now it's fully empty we can remove it deleted fully also removed from the apps make it remove takes time okay please now it's empty it should not take a lot of time yeah successfully deleted so we have no ugly package anymore we have some correctly created packages good names we use this good name package as a target package for our customization of customer 360 now you see everything looks good our changes that we made are saved in a proper place so let's how you can manage connections between packages and applications I agree this is not transparent so let's close open this register okay package installed application you see no ugly package at all we see our dev classic as a target for this app for real till we have only one package so you can easily add the new data here if necessary to connect some packages with some applications you can and do whatever you want of course you should be quite rational here without obvious mistakes that you can prevent because this is developer oriented tool if you intentionally do something incorrectly it will not save you and they will try to do what you're asking for so you should like consider yourself before making changes here because it's like architecture but you can manage thank you Adrian for your questions okay it's time for us to have it just a short break probably five or seven minutes and Adrian tells us about the question customize account page in freedom you want to generate new package yes it was in in January 2024 and the answer was from Ryan Farley where we had probably no such tool so he advised us to do something like movement of items and then just use this look up yeah yeah thank you thank you Adrian okay thank you for all of your active questions let's make a five or seven minutes break we'll refresh a bit and then move on with next topics thank you hi the battery yes so lucky I have a small question I have yeah so as I did we use it to have look up okay first one is for country second one is for city right so in the drop down button we have one plus icon is there one if you remember so what about which look up your interest that is it the main reality or main reality we have country and city right country drop down a city okay no country and city this one so I can't hear I can't hear proper city city country and city okay yeah yeah yeah so we have a plus icon over there right at the so what is the use of that or can we hide that button is possible so you ask about if it's possible to manually create new city for this okay can I can we hide that button this is will that button is possible this yes sure you can I just forgot to do this yes let me show you we can go to edit page I can find corresponding look up country and there is an option to allow add new value so we can disable this and for city we will also disable enabling new values so just tick off save it and we will only be able to select from the list without possibility to add any new entries close open now you see some selection now you see only available goals thank you like him states oh you have new Orleans no corresponding city okay thank you for a question any other questions feel free to ask because now I plan to show you something which will be a final step about user interface and you should know that we are working with freedom UI but maybe you will also need to work with some classic UI old project so you need to get some basic understanding of how classic UI can be managed and before proceed with classic UI customizations we need to make some preparation that is necessary and very important for classic UI so in order to create new section in classic UI you need to prepare target package we already did it here's our dev classic package but also you need to tell creation this package should be used and we will go to system settings then we will find a special system setting named current package open it and by default you see custom here is a current package Rack here is asking can we change the color of collects icon oh I'm not sure because it looks like this is a hard code thing so possibly you may find somewhere in CSS value for this color but it looks like this is an image designs are where in the app so it was not supposed to be customizable I think let me show you with CSS it's not possible probably it's because of this is an image okay let's try to to understand let's try to do inspect then you see we have so inspect some marker some kind of div and what else it looks like we have some image as you can see such images are hard coded but you may find where they are saved so possibly you can replace such images with something else you see the current source so you may try to replace actual storage of this image and you may design your own and that's how you finally make corresponding change Rack here is it clear of course it's not a commanded way of customizing creation by changing of its core files but physically you can try to replace this file with something else and check it out how it works at your environment and then you can if it's on site you can also get this file to the other let's say test and production environment so it may work for you you probably will not be able to apply such change at cloud conditions because cloud engineers will definitely will not agree for changing files somewhere in core part of creation and it will be not saved into your package so this is part for core which is not designed to be changeable by configuration changes but if you really want you can replace files on disk with another one and that's how you can do this thank you Rack here very interesting question and let's move on so I just wanted to explain you that in case if your plan is to use classic UI customization then you will have to take care about current package system setting by default it is set to save settings into custom package and we plan to save it into our dev class we should do this before starting of any customization and also take care this system setting is not cached cached settings are loaded at the start of user session and cached settings if you change them so you will need to fully apply changes and if you change cached setting you will have to log out and log in in order to read changed values properly for your user session in the current example current package is not cached so we may change it without logging out okay great so we can change save it then one more tip that you need to know before starting section wizard we may experience difficulties because of recent changes in object model without compilation without application restart so we will need to restart our app in order to guarantee normal work of section wizard especially on save object operation of section wizard as you remember restart of the app now can be done quite easily with maintenance tools made by our sweet partner so restart application this is necessary to normalize our server site cached data about object structure if you recently made changes in your object and even published it it still may keep some in current settings that application server level cache so we need to do this restart in this case everything will work okay good now we go to settings then we find item code section wizard and this tool is designed to create new classic UI sections I will quickly make some simple example not as complex as we made it for freedom UI just to demonstrate you such tool so I will do it fast may you may not to reproduce all the steps after me so it's up to you would you like to do this or not so I will make some new classic UI section when we do this we have to provide its title let's call it reality classic and we have to be very careful with code because code will not be able to change if we finish its input and that's why we have to type it correctly for the first attempt realty classic so this is our code once we move our focus out from this control you will see system will think for a bit and then we will not be able to change this code so if you made mistake then you only can cancel and run section wizard again work place okay let's put it to the same studio work place and background icon but it be green so it will be our icon for the color of our section icon okay great then we go to setup page we need to do some minor settings I'm still a bit afraid of what may go wrong when I save my section wizard section so I will only change something like name column I will provide some minor change copyable setting no any other settings so I will just go back and try to save my section in case if it saves correctly I'm happy and I can continue customizing of my section but in case if it fails to save and it will be obvious that I need some more steps to prepare my system then I will not lose time for setting up columns so saving objects is the most critical step of this procedure if it goes correctly then we will successfully continue our customization if it fails now it's correct yes great so if it fails we will make something like discovery of what went wrong but now in our case it looks like everything is okay great so we saved our section correctly now we can edit it and editing a section is much safer than creating it so we can go to edit page now we can customize it and I will quickly add similar columns as we had for freedom UI so decimal column drag and drop to be our price you see a bit different user interface but the same sense we add a new columns we provide title code no element code and just save I provide area I can use lookups is remember we made a lookup for type of our reality we can call this column usr type there is a reason why we use prefix is the same so system asks us to keep prefixes for our customized stuff bus telling that he has to leave no problem thanks you thank you thank you and you will watch readers great we will finish soon don't worry and today's Friday and probably tired a bit so copyable value type based on existing lookup a realty type of classic UI drop down list block be heavier no redondling no hiding titles everything is okay here save it great I will show you how we can make new lookups in classic UI no existing lookup so we have to make offer type code is usr offer type and no existing lookup so we will create one and as usual provide title for this new lookup reality offer type classic UI now this is how we provide title and code for our new created object that will be inherited from base lookup and register it as welcome by section wizard drop down list standard behavior but delete no any other options okay great and finally we can make some kind of text just to make comment by the way I will show you some trick which is supported in classic UI but is not yet performed in freedom UI comment here in their name is comment but what is interesting here we can make a special option called multi-line text you will see what will turn it into the column so multi-line text has a very interesting feature which is not implemented in freedom I will show it for you multi-line text obviously it's designed to make possible multi-line values here to be saved maybe it also makes sense to have 500 just to make sure we have big enough value but multi-line text has also very interesting property you will see it soon if necessary we can also add an object for detail and register the tail I will try to keep it simple we have business rows here similar to freedom UI and also we can program in javascript code if necessary and let's go back keep it simple and save the changes so I want you to see how classic UI section looks way in classic UI we have much more objects created for a section now you will see in configuration of course properties of package probably reloaded it okay saved correctly now I reload section with configuration so we can go to devclassic sort by date of modification and you will see how many new objects were recently created let me show you we have objects for file for folders for infoders for tags feature and also we have object for main classic Unity section and we have an object for our loop of created so we have much more objects for questic UI section because such things as tags folders and files are saved in a separate dedicated object and we have more tables for this the database and infredeum UI such tools are incorporated into commonly used objects for tags for files for folders and it makes it more efficient storage okay so let me show you how classic UI section looks like we will have this realty classic section but it probably will fail when we try to open so we have to reload because classic UI is much more sensitive to cache issues so you should always reload your page if you do any client site changes in classic UI you see it still faces some troubles let me show what's happening there or maybe we just have to wait now it doesn't look good okay let's go to another page go to realty classic page yes we have some minor issues here but in general it works okay let's try to add new record here you can see how classic UI page how classic UI edit page looks like I need to tell you that in classic UI we have a totally different background frameworks used for user interface in classic UI we use x-t framework x-t versions so you see it's quite old probably 10 years old framework and it's quite old but it works and it's a JavaScript framework which keeps controls and some UI stuff and in freedom UI we use Angular so classic UI uses x-t and teresoft core framework freedom UI uses Angular framework so it's totally different and module structure is similar but still we have some some serious differences when we create new record we didn't assign any default values so far so okay let's be berries current type is apartment offer type is not filled in so far and here is what I wanted to show you this is voice input and speech recognition piece so you see it works so only in classic UI in freedom UI we don't have it so far we don't have it in freedom UI so far and recognition quality is quite high as you can see so you may use it for classic UI implementations and I think that in freedom UI developers should develop something like this and enable it in freedom UI now we don't have it and offer type is empty so we have to probably take care about offer type for classic UI this one it's empty so we can simply add sale and rental for our classic UI and also we can bind all data to save it into our dev classic package so this is important step because such data also should travel to our test and production now if you go to realty classic you can see that offer type can be selected and we can save it okay looks good some minor steps minor preparations for our section we can go to work place setup studio now we have our section for classic UI quite far in low rows we can put it up for maybe we can also bind the conscience of this works pretty and the same save it successfully view details three items were created but you remember the first one will be information about work place only one data row nothing changed this one will be about position of a module in work place let's check real to realty classic grade third one will be about access rights that's okay I actually ask about ways languages it depends on browser and also I need to tell you this ways recognition feature is browser dependent for example if I try to do the same in my firefox let me show you my firefox here it still doesn't work in firefox let me quit let me show it for you it works in edge and in google chrome recently so I asked some colleagues it looks like it works in safari as well but unfortunately it doesn't work in firefox let me show you firefox here you see no support of this feature so it's also browser dependent and you should check and test it before you advertise this for your customers because it's browser dependent feature and it looks like it depends on each team of five elements or something like this so some browsers does not the some browsers do not support this and that's why you see it's not in browser okay thank you raki and what about languages so languages now let me go with this part now so languages are supported and I successfully used other languages to normally detect it you should change so if you change your user profile and change to another language then your voice input recognition will also support chosen language so yes it supports other languages at least two more languages which I tested it worked well for me thank you raki for your question so finally we had an example of a classic i-section we can set columns for our section list fields to display in classic UI we have different approach for setting up columns so we can provide column settings type maybe you need price offer type and finally we can have a maybe comment okay and then we can save it for all users when you save columns in classic UI for all users then it's possible to use data binding tool to help us to remember such columns set up in our package bind column setup for classic UI save it into our target package and by doing this we can transport setting of columns for this list to other environments so it will not travel automatically only if you make corresponding data item it will save it and you should do it default setting so you should save for all users and such default profile will be saved as data item to our package we can find it here reward and that's how we can change and transport classic UI columns setup to test and production this one is saved in this profile data at the same with details okay probably today's Friday and it's enough for today and I would just want you to see a couple of images of what client modules in classic UI works like so let's focus on client modules only now you see we have section page and we have edit page this one section page looks like a bit weird we have a not so good looking name of it we can try to modify it let's try to fix it so we can rename quest 6 something section but we should do the same code here and here we should do it very carefully save it now we will have better names for our client module also it will be renamed on disk you know with death classic package you will see realty classic section yes this one renamed and this one was also renamed so you see we have a full correct renaming on disk as well and after doing this I recommend you to instantly check it out if your section works well or not because now you see we have produced URL probably it will fail now and we have to probably go back somewhere like this go to quest secure section now you see another URL so now it works but we still miss columns because of changes and the previous column setup was set for a previous name of the previous name of the client module that's why we have to do it once again okay price type offer type maybe comment then we save all users providing so-called default profile this is important after we do this we can bind columns to our package creating one more data item in our quest 6 section data was bound successfully closed it now we have to review what we got in our package in order to remove previously created unnecessary data item here old one is not needed anymore because it represents all the values old settings which will be not so practical you see because we renamed our module and old name was remembered here even if we actualize it probably we will see there is no data for this oh it's still here but we do not need to keep such data in our package so we can remove it it doesn't represent any useful data for us this one is correct data with new client module so when you rename client modules because of ugly names check care about classic icon settings because you'll probably have to review them afterwards okay so final quick brief look at our client modules in classic UI so in classic UI section page looks like this when you open it you will see this code you will see define word module name dependency area factory function and some body so this is a body of our function which mainly returns an object with some set of settings in our case it's almost nothing so we have no any customization here classic UI pages are also inherited from some parent templates that's why we have a lot of common functionality and no need to implement this functionality each time in each separate section so our functionality is now in parent one and all the buttons for classic UI section like new actions view buttons grid folders feature tag everything is inherited that's why we do not need to customize it and that's why this code is so so so small but for page for edit page code you see much more significant difference so you can see set of you can see set of sections module name factory function returns a bigger object and you can see set of columns here so they are different from freedom UI you should focus on diff first because diff shows you information about user interface changes and each item in this diff array represents one control as the same as we add in freedom UI so if you need to change something you can do it carefully here or better to rely on section weather because it will do it better for you than you do manually and in classic UI section wizard doesn't allow you to use all available components so you should be so in general classic UI programming is harder because you can do some additional components and display them but section wizard does not support it so in some cases for example you want to add a button you will find at academic articles this definition of a button put it to your code provide corresponding handler and methods will be used at the place for your JavaScript functions to handle events of your controls so in classic UI you can also do almost the same programming as in freedom UI if really needed just tell me I can show you a bit more examples but I believe you will not focus on classic UI so hard and this is just for brief review for you okay that's all for today we just briefly mentioned classic UI and we probably need to pay some attention on migration from classic UI to freedom UI because it will be very typical tasks for most of our customers who started classic UI solutions and unfortunately such migration is not automated yet so today's session is over thank you very much for your time for your patience and questions next week we will start with some migration questions from classic UI to freedom UI and we will move on with server site programming so we will do some server site examples we're writing c-sharp code we will do integration of visual studio working with file system and so on and it's a final step for today it looks like I missed her code that I have to remember everything we did in file system of course and I will submit a diversion control just to keep all the history and any of you who wants to keep how our session will proceed you can also watch our repository at Github thank you for the time our session is over in case if you have any questions feel free to ask our session is over and goodbye thank you have a good weekend",

    "So, our main entity is a single record and then we need to keep information for example about different types of addresses for our customer or different emails or maybe it's a simple list of context connected to this account.",
    "And so, details they are usually connected with main entity with the help of lookups, look up columns and each detail record has information about its parent account and that's how system can filter through all addresses and show only addresses related to this currently selected data record.",
    "So let's go to our configuration section, select our package where we will work on, maybe we'll focus on objects first and we will create manually create new object.",
    "The default value will be provided in case if you try to add the new record, and it makes sense especially if you want to change for example till tomorrow but having similar time setting automatically value here will be quite good.",
    "So developers also realized that if we have no such option and let's imagine we have probably a solid end of out of the box objects for our big base product like sale service and marketing."
