We can make some default value just to make it easier to set up new values \nand will be system variable current time and date Default value will be provided in case if you try to add the new \nrecord. # Speaker 1\n\nSo such a column is usually not edited by end customer and it means that we have pretty no serious reasons to \ncontrol it with the help of foreign keys only in case if you try to remove corresponding contact then such created by \nor modified by columns should prevent this data from Removal. So developers also realized that \nif we have no such option and let's imagine we have probably thousand of out of the box objects for our big base \nproduct like sales, service and marketing. --- Page 5 ---\n\n# Speaker 1\n\nThe answer is that in case of detail management, when we add new data from the main edit page from main realty \npage, our parent realty will be already known and we should not allow to change it for user and we should probably \nshould not even show it for a user. So let's search for something connected to visits realty visit form \npage default page here means that it will be used for all scenarios to add, to browse, to edit data. So now we are going very close to understand what is \nreplacing object and why it is different from regular object and what is replacing view module or simply speaking \nreplacing client module from any previously known and studied types of client modules. Of course it's not recommended way of \ncustomizing creation by changing of its core files, but physically you can try to replace this file with something else \nand check it out how it works at your environment and then you can if it's on site, you can also get this file to the \nother, let's say test and production environment, so it may work for you.",
