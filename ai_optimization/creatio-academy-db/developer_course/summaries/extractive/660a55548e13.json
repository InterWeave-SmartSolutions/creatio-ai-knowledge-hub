  "summary_text": "Today is session number four of our development on creation platform, guided learning, set of practical sessions that we do for developing different features and functionality that require some programming on creation platform. And previously we finished with building our own section named Rheauty and we managed to set up the list view, we managed to make a form page for it, we also added some default values and we made some required fields and was pretty much easy and we used only no code customization tools for this. Today I will show you a bit more complicated examples of how you can do some programming and coding and also we will discuss the bugging, so you will see how it's possible to stop execution of your code and make it executed Y by line, line by line and to see all the variables and to see all the conditions, so to make something that you probably get used to do when you operate with any like modern version, modern development environment like Visual Studio or other. This data binding tool helps us to remember positions of all sections here and we can just click bind workplace specify target package and click save. It doesn't really necessarily because this workplace is already present at our system and when we for example try to optimize data and save it we will see warning and this warning will tell us that such studio workplace was already registered somewhere in parent package and even more it was registered at one more time in another parent package. You'll probably remember from our to use day session that when you create data items it's possible that you will make data item that will perform update not an insert. Now you can see that save was successful but we have a lot of warnings related to parent data that was already registered in base product and this is valid set of warnings because our change caused the change of position of all previously registered sections in studio workplace so simply all of the registered sections had different position because we moved our relative to the top and we had a warning that tells us that you're trying to change the data which was originally declared somewhere else so maybe you're doing it wrong so please take care here is your warning but this warning is still so we can ignore this and the last one is admin unit in workplace this is about access permissions system administrators have full access to studio workplace and probably this data is also present in our database yes so maybe not so necessary to save it so it's warning not an error in case if you have an error for example you save the same data twice in the same package in this case save button will show your error message and save button will not disappear if save button was disappeared it means your data item was normally saved is save button did not disappear it means an error it's like serious mistake and the system will not allow you to save such data it happens only when you save the same data twice in the same package okay so it was set of client modules of sorry set of data items automatically created by help of data binding tool when we register it our realty section in a studio workplace now we have comfort here is our new creative section here is set of processes we will manage very soon here we have lookups which we also often look at and use it and some other system sections that we may need so we now have very comfortable conditions and easy transitions between different sections so it was just a simple example how you can organize your workplaces in more complicated these products like sales service and marketing you will see more workplaces more sections inside and you also can create your own workplace with sections that you think will be necessary to use for your end users with particular roles and you can provide permissions for such sections and for such workplaces and what is important for you to understand that you can create many different workplaces and include the same section many times so if you added some section to some workplace it doesn't mean that you can't do it with another workplace so one context section can be added in different places with no limitations in my case I have my applications workplace with realty section and I also have just a second so that what I wanted to show you we can use the same section in different workplaces and it's not a problem if we specify the same section in different workplaces many times so physically this is the same section the same data shown in different places just a second okay so what we will do today it was a warm up example that I think will be interesting for you to know so let's do something more serious let's think of improvements of our future section of our realty section and now I want you to see how you can do some calculations how you can do some more serious programming inside of a creation client site page using some JavaScript and using creation tools and let's say data platform first of all I will explain you some business ideas so what we plan to do my plan is to show you some recolculations and it could be a good example if we for example create one more column call it commission so it will be our future profit from the deal and this commission will be dependent on price so it's normally and very typical for realty to have commission as some percent from price and also we have to take care about the type of offer so for sale we have one formula and for rental we will have another formula okay let's do it step by step so first of all we need new column new column can be added to this very easily we can just go to modify our page then we can add the new number column carefully drop in it here it will be named commission commission and as we have a price in US dollars so where it be commission also in the same currency the inner column name will be USR commission and we confirm such code for this column the data format will be decimal with two digits okay great decimal with two digits and we want to make this commission calculated automatically so we don't allow users to manually change it that's why I will set a redone option on I temporary hide this attachment tab so my commission will be redone only and also just to make it easier to find in diff array I will name its element code so we can type it as we wish commission usd where it be our element code this element code will be used in view config and also physically it will be used for building real page html markup with set of divs inside and this code will be used to name set of items and div html tags inside of our page so element code it's about physical component representation on the page okay you already know this and that's all you can just save system automatically modify our object it will save changes to our page code which we can find here if we click open source code so now it's just click save and and let's probably be enough for the beginning so this change will be made in objects and in our client module okay finally it saved okay we can move on and now we can close this page editor go to main page as you can see I did not even reload it we can just open it again and probably we will immediately see our new column and it's redone so you see this lock sign which tells us that column is redone so now we need to think of implementing recolculation and it will be triggered by change of price and also we want to make it dependent on offer type so for the sales offer type it will be more or less okay if we make commission like 2% from list price from our price of a reality shown here so to be quite fair and good enough commission for our business and for sales it's totally okay now let's create some sample for house for rental our rental price will be 1200 bucks for some house in Miami I'm not sure that can refine so cheap houses in Miami for maybe it's not a like not in a high season and some area and as you can see commission will be recolculated and we need to make another formula for rentals so for rentals probably it will be quite enough if we will ask for 50% from monthly payment price if this is a rental so for rentals we will have another percent so for sales it will be 1% by 2% value and for rental it will be 50% from price value so when we will do some calculation we have to take care about it but also you should be mentally ready that in real life business it really often happens that such ratios such formulas can be changed from time to time and once we introduce hard coded value like 2% a month later our customer may call us and say you know now conditions were changed so we need to modify this percent and now it will be 2.5 could you please change it and if we hard code it of course it's not so good idea to go into code and change it then deliver changes to production so it will be really really expensive to make such changes and our customer will be not ready will be not really happy if we ask for example for half maybe for a couple of hours of work to be paid if we want to change just one number ideally customers should be able to change such ratios themselves we have several options to do this for example we can make a separate table which will keep necessary pros percents or we can use some system settings for this or as you can see our ratio is really stick to offer type so probably we can add the new column to offer type lookup in order to save one value in percent for sales and another value in percent for rentals I will show you how we can do this let's focus on objects again now we have offer type object we can open it for edit I prefer to work from configuration section maybe you would like to focus on application first in this case you can do the same if you oh I did not save it sorry okay my fault will be housed for rental save it great so if you prefer to focus on application we can go to application hub you may find your real-t app you may check your data models and that's how you can find corresponding object or you can switch to advanced settings to see all the contents of your sedution so you may practically do almost the same as you can do it here so I just get used to work with this configuration section also it has some useful actions like save packages to file system so that's why I stick to this approach and I feel more confident when work here because I have full available set of tools to manage my system set my system configuration setup so we opened corresponding object we have inheritance from base lookup and that's why we have eight inherited columns and we did not add any other own columns so far so for each reality overtype for rental or sale we can add one more column to be number maybe you can do it with quite high precision okay two digits after decimal point we can call it something like commission percent so we can even specify what is the available range of our data values here just to make it clear for any user what type of value should be put here so if we specify from 0 to 100 it means from 0 to 100 percent and it will be clear how to put some value here if you want to save for example 2 percent one more column is not a big deal so we can easily edit save and publish but after we do this we may start to get some additional unexpected difficulties now I will show it probably sometimes I get it sometimes not but anyway I have to tell you about this so we added new column to some object that was already present for today morning so it was already created recently and that's why we can face some unexpected behavior let me show you what I'm talking about now you can see it's very close and easy to switch between our section and for example lookups let's go to reality over type lookup and let's try to see its data now we have name and description okay let's try to set up columns to display name is okay here description is also okay and we can try to display one more column commission percent looks good and we can save it okay here this commission percent looks good we need to provide some initial data because we have to support our solution with some some initial values for calculations and we agreed that for a sale it will be enough for us to specify 2 percent according to this helpful message to percent will look like this 2.00 so it means just two and for rentals we expect to earn 50 percent but from monthly payment so our price will represent monthly payment that's why for rentals we will have significantly bigger value so it looks like our data is okay here but we changed columns and we added some data so possibly we have to look at data part and find corresponding object reality of for type object so not object data item for this let me find it this one offer type it looks like it was created by data binding tool so we could also no no no this is look up registering no I need to find it here this one values so now we have one more column here we can update this data item with the help of data binding tool or we can manually modify it by adding one more column as you can see originally this column was not present here because we created data item before adding new columns to the object so now we have one more column here we have new data 2 percent for sale 50 percent for rentals we have to save it everything is okay so our new column our new values are here in our data part great it looks like we still did not need to do any additional steps related to adding new column into existing object but some of you may start to fill some difficulties and such difficulties are connected with the way how server side system remembers information about objects and unfortunately it may happen that your kind of difficulty which you will finally face will be an ability to display data here or an ability to use a new column a bit later in order to fix this you may need maintenance tools for creation so which we already installed maintenance tools can help us to restart the app or clear edges if I needed I will do this restart but a bit later now I will try to avoid this to show you what will happen if you did not perform a restart so let's check will we be able to make all the way all the settings as I plan to do this and the will we need restart or not so let's go now we have offer type which also has additional data for sale value we have one additional data and for rental value we also have another additional data and it's really really lucky for us that it's possible to get such additional data out from this lookup somewhere at the top where we can easily use such data columns now I plan to show you how to get data out from a lookup we will use again page editor our task is to get decimal value from this offer type lookup and display it somewhere the reason why we need to display is to make it visual and also to make it fully no code so now you will see the trick how we can make data out from existing lookup we have new fields here but if you add any it will add new column to your object and it will add new control to your page so such columns I would like to call data fields and data fields represents connection between controls and real life data column of your main object that this page works with but if you scroll down you will find interesting set of components called inputs inputs are designed to organize input only without direct connection with your main data object and without direct save of any data that you input into this call simply speaking inputs are controls that you use for inputs but not intended to save data from them or at least not save into main primary object with the standard tools so maybe you will save it somewhere somehow else let me show you how I can use this for our task I need number control so I will take number and carefully drag and drop it somewhere on my page this is just control this input field with no any connection to any kind of objects and the data model but we have a traditional function which will be really helpful for us we can ask system to fill this number control from some column that we can take out from existing lookups or existing from existing fields let me show you how we can do we go to data source click on this lookup button and then we will search so select some data field which we will use to fill this control real team related objects it will show us all existing lookup in our real team object and then we will find offer type extended and system will show us only only suitable on the compatible field which will be you can be used within decimal number control this is our commission percent so we will select it and here now you will see some changes title appeared the same as title of your column inside of your offer type lookup code appear and cannot be edited this is redone and also you can unlock it so this column will be constantly redone title position pay title on the page and element code number input so we can call it something like permission per set okay and save change of our element code so simply speak and we made redone live column that will be automatically loaded each time offer type is set and each time offer type changed or cleared let's save our changes and we will see how it works by the way please confirm with plus in our chat if you follow me directly during the session so I need to know today allow you some pose to do some steps after I demonstrated merch how thank you andre thank you okay I will go not too fast so you have enough time if something is not good and you would like me to stop for for while tell me please okay Monica thank you again the crowd and Raki thank you for mentioning great so we saved our page then we can go to our page close open it again now you see this commission percent is shown okay maybe we can remove the page just to suppress any possible issue with the browser cache so let's open again a partner of norlings we have offer type sale but you see this commission percent is not shown okay let's try to select another one rental where I chose sale again okay rental 50 sale 200 to okay save it close such data will be not possible to see in list so we have no reality column which will represent our commission percent we can read it from the database if we use related objects if we use offer type and if we display commission percent and this commission percent will be obtained from corresponding record from our offer type but you see now we have some troubles we have some troubles and system does not recognize commission percent column fully probably it also shows us some error messages I believe let's try to reload it and see what happens now no error message it just does not show us corresponding values but they are definitely there so we can go to lookups we can find our offer type lookup we can find columns there so our commission percent is here so what is happening and why we have such a trouble and if we open the page you see no initial value here but if you click there and back to sale now you see this value is okay save close open and still it doesn't go so we still have some problem with this additional column and this problem unfortunately cannot be solved by logging out and logging in so let me show you I try to log out maybe thinking there is something like a user session cache issue then I try to log in when you work with client side it's better to keep your browser console on probably you will see some interesting messages there or a lot of red messages in case of errors so it's important quick okay opening our IoT section ignoring all warnings here opening it once again and you see no it did not help us so unfortunately logging out and logging in doesn't help you and the only solution which we can do is restart our app or shut it down and start it again for example with the help of ias manager but it will take more than a minute for us to normally shut down and start so we have a quick solution this is restart our app and we have a maintenance tools for this restart application this is the only way to quickly fix this issue now you see we have some some errors in browser console but it looks like not very critical so now restart is being performed we can check what's happening with our memory and with our processes using task manager w3wp looks like we have the same worker process but it has a comment to restart or possibly to reload some of its assemblies okay so we restarted our app go to real to section now we already will see the difference now you see that commission percent here was normally displayed in this list previously it was not normal and if we open any record now commission percent will be fully normally loaded when we just open the page so you see commission percent loaded correctly if you take any other value yes if you go to rental yes it's okay so now we fixed it and that's why I add to use this add-on code maintenance tools for creation such add-on helps me easily restart the app we just wait in approximately 10 seconds and it's much easier than restarting my app by shutting down and starting again my worker process or recycling worker process it's possible so it will take significantly longer okay so we fixed this question with the commission percent and now now our task is to make actual calculation so now we can think of how to trace changes of price or commission percent luckily commission percent will be available for us the same as any attribute for a real column so commission percent will be also an attribute for us so if this value changes or if this value changes as you can see it will be changed in case if you clear in case if you set some overtype or if you change to another overtype commission percent is changed so price or commission percent trigger recalculation of commission I will show you how we can do this let's go to our configuration section find client modules we are working with form page so when we look at this stuff you can see this is a real t form page that's why I know where to open corresponding code so you can also open the code from page editor if you want I just feel it more comfortable to work here so form page open source code that's how we can go directly to the JavaScript part of it and see what's happening andrian is asking is it possible to use this add-on in a cloud environment yes all creation apps from marketplace can be installed on cloud systems absolutely the same as you can install it to work on it when you install any add-on you use only web interface so it will work absolutely the same let me show you so you go to settings you go to application management application hub and then you click install or add new application and you can select something from this list or you can select marketplace power it and it will work absolutely the same if you run it in cloud thank you Adrian for your interesting question let's move on with your code so we found a real t form page we decided to open directly its source code that's how we open this tab we can try to find our commission div part you can see this our commission column it was added by help of page editor so practically we should not modify this but it will be interesting to see how it will be connected with the data attribute the ds usr commission usr so this is our attribute name okay we can collapse temporary all such things i will only show you so price okay we need price we need commission so we can collapse all other new content div items till we will face view model config so attributes of view model config represents set of variables that can be saved on the page level and we already started to work with it yesterday i just tried to explain you such attributes and now we will work with them so for the price column we see this attribute name okay and for the for the percent here we have this attribute name and finally we will save our data into commission attribute which has this name this is important okay i will collapse anything else add to make it clear and quite compact for you so we are interested in price attribute percent attribute and commission attribute okay nothing else model config is not interesting and then we will do something with handlers i already have an example which will make it possible for us to do it quickly so let me show you this example of the code samples written y and then we need calculated filled example okay okay we did filled example so now i will use special pre-designed handler name probably we need to look at academy to explain all possible handler names so let's go to academy let's go to go to guides the development front and three w i and somewhere we will see some client schema differences handlers yes this is an article explaining handlers and their definition so we have some set of standard names for handlers and they represent some important steps of page lifecycle in our case we are interested in the handler which is trigger it each time when some data some attribute data changed at our page changes the attribute so this handler is called handle view model attribute change request let me show you my example handle view model attribute change request so simply speaking this handler will be called each time when any column value changes at our user at our client site page in our browser so this handler will be triggered quite often with copy this code we will also paste it for you and we will copy it and put it to our examples in our handler's area so this is an array we have to keep syntax well and that's why i tried to paste it like this keep in commas break it and so on so now you see this piece of code was just simply added this piece of code was added and let's check what we can do with it of course we have to take care about attribute names because they are always unique each time you do the same example again you will see different unique names so how we can check it this handler will be called quite often for each column change and in order to make it efficient we need to check if some column that we are interested as changed or not if yes then we do our recolculation if not we should do nothing in order to save system resources so we check request property here and we have attribute name and if this attribute name is our price then this is logical or or attribute name is our commission then we do some calculation but we have to actualize our names so we can see our list of attributes for the price here is our attribute name let's copy it and carefully paste here and also as we already have it in our click board here when we need to read it then the same for commission percent let's make sure this is our attribute name yes it looks like it is already the same because generated by system and I usually do same examples let's change shifts okay we didn't do so so now you see if price changed if commission percent changes then we take price value we take commission value so how we do this I already showed you yesterday we have to use operator a bait then request is our argument door context and then we have access to our certain attribute so we have a just variable in our javascript code for price for percent then we do calculation of commission as a result of multiplication and don't forget to divide by 100 because commission percent represents percent not just decimal value okay and then we will save our commission percent we have to provide correct value here is our commission attribute if we do it incorrectly we will fail so this is important our commission value will be finally saved into this okay now it's ready and we can check how it works by saving our code I provided an example for you so we can also check out your example just a second okay saving was successful and we can move on with our checks let's go to real this section open the page let's try to trigger change of price or change of offer type for example like this nothing happens probably it's because of cash so let's reward the page the loading helps to fight with browser cash effects open again try to make changes now you can see that recoculation works well so we have our price for rental of our apartment and you see our commission is correctly recoculated and we can save our data commission will be also saved we can see it here permission is our legal valid column so it will be saved let's open some sale example now you can see okay price was not changed commission is already calculated let's check if we switch from sale to rental you see commission was recoculated if we switch back to sale it's also quite well calculated so now you see that our commission is quite fair for this amount of price for the house so our recoculation also works well and it shows even when pages opened it looks like when pages opened our data filled in in client sites or triggers recoculation even if we do not change anything but just open the page yes we'll see so it looks like our calculation is already done and works quite well and of course everything works quite smoothly when we have a pre-programmed examples where everything is correct but in real life you will do your own examples where some errors or mistakes could happen so you will need to know how to debug this code I will show you how to make such debug and you will see that's not so difficult one of the easiest ways to debug is to put a special debugger breakpoint into your code like this the word debugger if you provide such debugger it means that you ask for debug session and you stop execution or you JavaScript code and if your browser has opened browser developer console so if browser developer console is on then your debugging will work for you but this approach has also disadvantage and when you finished your debugging you should not forget to remove all your debugger lines save your changes again and ideally you have to run your logic again just to make sure you did not accidentally damage anything because when you save you have chance that something will be incorrectly saved something will go not so well okay so let me show you how we can do this type of debugging I need to explain and I need to show you we can go to this is easy way to put the bugger word I will show you a bit more professional way we can go to our section open page which we plan to debug then we enable browser developer console you can do it by f12 for control shift i and when you do this you then go to sources tab you see we already opened some set of scripts here we don't need it now let's close everything and then we can just search and you see we have a usr reality form page page part of the URL so it's a page it's a name of client module and we can try to find it control p open file let's try control p open file which one reality form page usr reality form page we have two options here probably because of browser cache okay if you do not want to guess which one is correct we can go back reload the page so we will suppress any kind of cache and then we will open it again and we have no just one option single option to select corresponding control p okay open the page then control p open file and press control p usr reality and you see only one form page here so no any cache to know any any duplicates that will make you confused and so you probably may select incorrect one so let's open the only one you see set of recognizable strings here but the most important of course is our code and you will see our module text here big part with new config div some part your model config and finally you will have your header handlers part we are interested in debugging somewhere here for example we can click on this line number which will make a break point for us so it's the same as debugger but it doesn't change the source of our client module so we can use browser debugging tools for this click on the line number that's how we activate breakpoint so here we have one break point that we just clicked here then when your browser developer console is on and execution comes to this line execution will be stopped let me show you if you change for example offer type from rental to sale you see these lines are executed and now code stops and we can go line by line now we have to use tools that will help us to proceed with this piece the most popular I think the most efficient is f10 which is a step over running of a line without going into some functions for it so I will press f10 now you see my price was taken from the column percent now you see new percent was taken when offer type changed then you can see commission was recalculated now you will see commission will be set here so my commission is now 26 so I expect it to be saved here yes 26 and then we move on so here we can use the zoom f8 hotkey to normally continue execution that's how we can check this code if we change the price you will see the same I press f10 I have another commission f8 okay we can make more serious price for an apartment and obviously we will have more serious commission so that's how you can debug your code also if your code has something have some obvious mistakes and the causes runtime errors you will also see such runtime errors in your sources tab you will also see your console which will be full of red messages so in case if your code fails in runtime of course you should take care about it and look at your console tab and check if everything works well or not when you finished your debugging you should click on line number again removing your breakpoint and then your code will run without stops it's interesting to see what the value we will see in case if we will clear of our type now let's check you see that percent is empty so percent is now trying to multiply now on price results in zero so that's how we will clear okay when we have some valid percent we can move on with f8 and you see setting is done if you have any questions related to this debugging please tell me as you can see debugging can be really effective if your code is more complex if you have sub functions if you are not sure what values you finally get from your code so you can check it out with the help of browser developer tools okay probably we got an hour of our session so let's make a five-minute break and then move on with next topics related to programming I also plan to show you some examples of programming of validation so I plan to show you validation and different validators so different calls will be used for universal validation and also I plan to show you some examples of so we're displayed debugging but also you need to know a bit more about logging okay so let's make five minutes break so today I want you to see some more technical things about how client's side works and how we can do some technical steps of it so we didn't know how to debug our code now it's also like to you to see that we have quite developed logging so I will show you logging mechanisms that are available on creation platform here is our installed app and this is our folder it's installed application we go to teras of the web and you already know that creation uses and log libraries to provide the different logs and save them in creation web server the most important log file for us is and log targets config because here we can change the fault file to save our all default folder to save all our logs you may be interested in the way how we can do some logging so we have so-called appenders and targets and they probably have to start from appender first so analog config I should use analog config first and we have a lot of loggers as well appenders so they are synonym logger or appender they are synonyms so you can see a lot of different loggers registered and appenders are settings that will collect log messages and finally the appenders will be connected with physical files so you see we have more than 100 different loggers and logger is a logical thing that you can use in your program code appender is a place that you use to collect your data and save it so we have a lot of loggers a lot of targets sorry targets and you see we have so appenders it means it's a setting that represents physical file also targets are synonym and appenders shows us that we also have a lot of different logs that are saved here and you can see different messages different settings so what do you need to know about this so creation has a lot of default types of logs and all of them will be saved in a folder which we specify when we install our application so in analog targets config line number three we have setting to save our logs to by default this folder is somewhere in temp catalog windows temp I decided to make it different so we can find logs and as you can see we have zero which means main application logs and log folder which which sorry a log folder which means a loader part is not so interesting because it has no customizable items that will be interested for us to interesting for us to see so loader is there a technical and we have just several log files here nothing very spectacular and zero folder is what we really need because it a log set of logs for our main application and then we go inside we see logs for each separate date so you see for different days we'll have a logs in different folder which makes it easy to find and then you see different logs here in total we have more than 50 different files with logs sailed here so a lot of different logs a lot of different files and what is the most important for you from the maintenance point of view I think the most important is error log error log represents all exceptions and keeps information about all exceptions that happened in your system so error log shows all errors and of course you should take care about it because usually it is important and sometimes you may find some errors which are not related to your changes so you may simply speaking find some errors from base product like this one error parent schema is now parent AD sets to empty and so on but it looks like nothing very critical for our application you see the same error many times and it looks like not very important but if you will get some error messages here related to your functionality and your users will start to complain about something is not working of course you cannot ignore this you may ask me why we have some errors in a like production release software the answer is that creation is quite big and we have more than 200 libraries we have millions used cases that could be checked and used so it's really hard to test everything and to polish any line of code so it should so it could not fail in any way so in real life in any big system some errors usually happen but in our case it's not so critical so you can simply ignore but if you will find another errors with some user complaints of course you should take care of it so from maintenance point of view I think looking at such error log is quite important and this is something that you should do regularly if you support some big creation implementation by your own in cloud conditions looking at such logs is complicated because you will not be able to directly go to cloud-based file system to get it so you only can ask for help at support team by the way you should know support team leaves here support at creation.com so they work 24-7 it means you can ask them anytime anytime you need even on weekends and if you ask for example for a yesterday logs for a search and website they can give it for you but it will be more efficient if you can collect logs by yourself and that's why I plan to show you some special tool which makes it easier if you need to collect logs from cloud-based environment so I will show you now I'm talking about telemetry log for creation this is a special add-on which we can get from application hub new application marketplace power it then we can just search for the word log and we will easily find this hoku app or telemetry log for creation so hoku is a company physically this company is like founded by our creation please and this is something just so you should consider it made by creation and you can install this telemetry log this is for free agree confirm you see it was just updated 2023 November okay and install it it takes just almost no time maybe 20 seconds and you will see that new app is installed to our system so you'll be able to collect logs but you'll be able to collect only runtime created logs so it's like listener logs you will not be able to collect yesterday logs but if you do some experiments and you need to see how logs look like when you do your experiments in cloud so this app will be extremely helpful for you because it shows you all the messages all the log messages that are saved on disk so you can listen to any logs saved on disk let's patiently wait for its installation surprisingly it takes a bit longer and I expect it but it's okay now it's not so critical maybe we can look at browser developer console here but usually no troubles should be created okay let's wait for a minute and I'm also curious about what is happening at my website oh dot net exer was running so it looks like compilation was done so system I decided it needs to compile and that's why it was so slow okay finally our compilation finished we can download installation log to see what it took so long and what operation took so long to install so now you will see results very great here's our installation logs started 2658 so almost 27 finished 29 it looks like two minutes and three seconds and yeah it's a bit longer than usual and 27 15 28 56 so it looks like full configuration compilation was performed that's why it took so long and okay no problem we can live with it so now you will see one more app here in this list telemetry and you can reload this tab now you will see one more item at our settings page previously called system designer currently it's called settings so I will show you how we can use this telemetry log here yes now let me show you we can check you probably remember we looked at our logger and appenders so we have appenders we have loggers here so we can listen for a certain logs in order to get some error messages for the certain let's say subject or certain area of functionality and you can also listen everything like this which will mean that you look and get every message and try to find the logger for sql do you have anything now let me find a corresponding logger sql so it's called teres of core db executor sql log appender okay very db executor and we only interested in for example errors so I plan to make example of listening of db execution errors and I especially will do some example which makes such an error let's go to customer c60 find accounts and let's try to remove some account obviously we will not be able to do this because it has some connections with existing contacts so I try to delete this account now you see no no messages here try to do this of course I see error messages and here I expect to get I expect to get error messages oh I should subscribe I should remember to subscribe okay let's try to delete once again yes error message appears logger pattern maybe you should use info subscribe I would try to delete it once again yes now you see any thing but it was not an error it was just a warning so like yellow color which means this is not an error just a warning and okay so I got some text message from our db executor and you see that my message has an error so exception occurred statement terminated and you see that we get some text messages and logs you can also get the same logs if you go to your files you will find sql json here we will have similar information so you see my delete statement failed so it conflicts with foreign reference constraint and it's interesting that for the sql errors system logs only clears but were failed so only curious that failed to be executed at the database in my case I intentionally made an error for the database level and they showed you how you can handle it and how you can track it you can also use all existing loggers for all messages subscribe you will have plenty of different messages here just when you go to any part of your system when you open any section you will start to get more and more logs because system usually writes something to logs and it has quite where both is login so you will have more and more data you see more messages appear it some of them are useless for you and so you have to play a bit with it but finally you will be able to do the same as you can do with log files so this telemetry log procreation will be extremely helpful in case if you need to make some experiments and get logs directly in online mode from your cloud environments including even production systems so this can be really helpful for you please remember about this telemetry log and you have some buttons here what is this as you can see we have some help message explaining how to use this some button which shows or it runs and stops a listening of logs so green means run red means stopped and that's how you can also use it so listening all of the logs will provide you a word of verbose noisy messages it's up to you so maybe this will be interesting for you so just remember the name of the tool is telemetry for creation you can easily install it from marketplace okay so what else you need to know about client site we will work with details soon and before we do this I need to explain you how to do validation as you can see my previous program was a bit more oriented on caustic UI so sometimes I jump from topics to topics and that's why we are not following directly from this schedule so I plan to provide you material like step-by-step slightly improving complexity of topics so I think it's not so hard not so difficult for you to study this material this way so let's move on validation what it is about and this is check of data before it will be saved at server set let's return back to our reality section and let's look at our data values so when we add the new values it may happen that user may save some very incorrect values for example we can try to save negative price as you can see as a result we have negative commission it's also possible to save negative area and also system does not prevent us from doing such things so we can save it and as you can see from system point of view there is no troubles no errors but of course we have trouble from business point of view because we can't normally summarize values we can't normally calculate commission so we have to make some kind of protection for our data input and luckily we have this on the platform level as existing validation tools let me show you how to use it we also need to program this unfortunately validation is only available when you do programming so it's not a no code setting but we are not afraid of this let's go to our configuration section find our form page again open its source code again and I need to show you some examples at our academy documentation which will really help you so we have some architectural SDK things at front end documentation but we have a lot of useful examples in platform customization area of our academy and we have examples for freedom UI for fields examples and we have examples of population of fields so it's example of calculations that we already discussed and we have example of validation of field which we are interested right now so I will share useful links for such articles I recommend you to read it or just maybe a book edit so let me explain how we plan to move on we have special area in our code named named validators let me show you so we have handlers and we have validators so it's a special designed place for us to program special functions that will be used for checks of data during input and luckily we have examples at academy which will help us to make it smoothly without spending too much time so validators is a collection this is not an array now you see this is a collection each collection item should include its name and implementation and validation implementation includes validator property which is a function that finally should return something set of parameters and a sync property then when we finish with this part we will connect our created validator with set of columns so we may use one validator for many different columns by connecting them to our page actions so let me show you how we can do this and I already have an example we will not spend too much time on it so now you will see how we can do this validation first of all we go to validators area and we will provide some code here I already have example no different code is so freedom you have validation example and I need to provide this example of code okay let me copy and paste for you this is example of our validation okay no need to use cameras to show okay so this is example of code and I will also implement it it's my own validators area so copy and paste what do we see here so we register my validator with a specific name so this is a kind of type or maybe validator validator type let's call it so and we can declare different numbers so unlimited number of different validators this validator includes three major properties validator function parameters and a sync property so probably you have to start with parameters first because parameters are values that we can provide for each validated column and for different columns we can provide different parameter values here we have to declare what parameters we will have in my case there are two parameters min value and message parameter validator function has a bit complex structure basis one function it returns another function and first function requests config another function requests control inside of control unfortunately we only have value so it makes it difficult for us to analyze several values from different columns on our page but it makes it universal if we have value we don't know exact columns so we can use the same validator for many different columns of different columns and it will be universal for us so we can take value and from the config we know what parameters we expect so we have min value parameter and we have message parameter our check is quite simple we get value and then compare with min value and in case if our value is greater or equal than min value then we think that data is correct and our turned result will be no which means no warnings no messages everything is okay but in case of values not correct we have to return special type of result which is a javascript object with a specific name the property inside and with the message property inside of this property so it's kind of nested javascript object and our message here will be text it shouldn't be displayed nearby problem control and also this message will be displayed when we will try to save our page so we will try to save data just and we will check all the validators and it will find that some columns are not correct and it will not allow to save it so this is our example of a validation but it's not applied yet so we have to set up some columns which will work with this validator otherwise our validator is useless because no column expect checks with it so I do not need to change anything here this code is universal as you can see no any hard code at column names only one hard code thing is a validator type name next step is connection of validator with a certain columns or it's better to say with attributes so I will show you examples how we can connect really I should do it here how we can connect validators to columns and I will put example so I have to find my price attribute let's go to my view model config div area here we have attributes here is my price attribute inside of its structure after model config I have to provide validators setting so I should carefully copy this and paste it here and that's how I will put it so here's my price attribute here's my validator the type of validator should be matched with what we created and parameter so the minimum value for the price I think it will be 50 so we will not allow to save any reality object with the price less than 50 bucks okay and also we can use message not just a plain string constant which is also supported but also we can use localizable string here is an example of a macro that you can use for localizable strings and localizable strings are saved separately and can provide translations into other languages so let me show you what localizable strings I plan to use I will put it for you and first localizable string about price so my localizable string is named price cannot be less I go to localizable strings probably you can save it before modifications but now I will modify my localizable strings take significantly longer than usual as you can see my workuprocess consumed quite a lot of RAM it's more than usual okay we can try to create a localizable string with the code price can't be less and the value is price cannot be less than something okay try to add and then I expect some troubles here that's why I will try to save now if it saves correctly okay no problem but in previous versions I experienced some troubles with localizable strings here and it turned out to save it so when I added once it physically added it twice and then denied to save because it tells that such a localizable string already exists in case if you face this kind of issue when you add a localizable string try to save and then get error message about duplicate the localizable strings you can just remove that visible one that you created another one which is invisible will be still saved so that's how you can bypass this bug as you can see creation also as any software it has its own bugs sometimes bugs are detected fixed new bugs appear it so it's normal more or less normal for any software another localizable string that you will need is about area so localizable string for area and for its value here save it area can't be less it's try to save and my intention when I save each time I add the localizable string is to check do I have any bugs or the localizable string it looks like in this version this bug by finally fixed that's nice so for the price where are they set settings now we do the same for area so let me show you what we do for area we'll set validators setting for one column we can use multiple validators so it's possible to make checks with different criteria and in my case for the area I will use the same validator but minimal value will be 100 square feet so it's close to 10 square meters we think that we will not input any kind of reality less than 10 square meters or 100 square feet and that's our limitation here and we will use localizable string that we already successfully saved okay now we have this example save it and then it's our turn through test and check out how our data were saved how well it looks we can close our editor go to main app probably let's reward it just to fight with any potential impact of browser cache issue then let's open any record and especially intentionally open the record which has incorrect stuff here now you see that once we finished and moved focus out of control you see we have some checks and these checks displays error message price can't be less than 50 bucks area can't be less than 100 square feet if we try to save such data just a little reject it tells us we have problems and we have to fix them okay let's fix only price try to save we still have trouble with area when we fix area then our troubles are over and system saved it normally please note that if you do something like this and try to save your data validation works at client side so it doesn't send any messages to server side now you see nothing appeared in network tab until we will fully fix our rental price in this case you see update query executed so physical data was sent to server side only in case of successful client validation so this validation may help you to improve your logic to make it more protected so get rid of like silly mistakes made by end users and I think that this is something that will be quite important in your future projects and implementation now I plan to show you some simple topic and it's simple but it's very important because such topic will be quite often faced in your in your projects it will be not really directly connected with programming but it's something that you definitely should know about I'm talking about typical settings of columns that you need according to some conditions for example some column must be visible only in case of a certain condition and otherwise should be hidden or another column must be required according to some conditions and otherwise should be optional and also you may need some like we talk about visibility about required settings or about read only columns so such a typical settings for columns are frequently faced in requirements from business owners and that's why such functionality was decided to implement as a no code tools and developers called such functionality business rules let me show you how you can manage such business rules and I will show you a couple of examples we can go to modify our page so edit page then we go to special button business rules please note we have two types of business rules page business rules mainly used for controls visibility maybe required property read only property and also they have object business rules here it's called reality business rules but you should understand this is about object object business rules also offer us possibility to make some filtering and so depending on the type of business rule it will be physically saved into metadata of a page or into metadata of an object so let me show you let's imagine our task is quite simple to show comment only in case of type is not empty so when we add new data type could be not specified in this case comment should be hidden let me show you how we can do this we can use page whoever business rules because it's about column visibility and new rule this rule will have automatically generated title for the apply to the page and it has triggering condition pages open or some condition changed so we have if scenario and then action okay let's start with if if and now we will think of something like I should do it a bit better with initial status okay so if our type is not empty then comment should be visible let's try to do this attribute or data field realty and our type okay if type is not empty so we can use condition is filled in if this condition is true then we will use action show elements on the page and we can decide what element will be shown to be input column of a comment text comment so if type is filled in comment will be visible otherwise comment will be hidden so let's try to test how it works we can save it save our page now and let's check how it will be physically working for us as you can see each time you develop something this is very important to immediately test it when it's ready and when you make many different changes you may think of okay I will do many changes then I will test them in total I do not recommend you to follow this approach so it's much better and more safer if you will do some small step then you go to your system and start to test it then you do another small step then you do another test the reason is that create your client site sometimes could bring you surprises and it will be not so clear according to the error message text in your browser console to understand what exact part gave you such a surprise so it's better to make small steps and to test it frequently so once you get and start to get some error messages then you will easily understand that it was caused probably the most latest recent changes and you should take care about it and maybe revert them maybe to look carefully and you will find some errors so small steps and frequent testing this is what I recommend to you so let's open any record type is set comment is visible it's clear the type now you see it's a bit uncertain so it's not clear it and let's set it again okay if you clear it it doesn't work I think that we have a problem because of initial state of this column let me show you how we can fix it initial state should be aligned with our business role and in case if we check some condition and turn this column on so make it visible so by default this comment should be hidden let's select comment that said it's visibility default visibility not visible and then save our changes so by default comment will be hidden and according to the business role it will be enabled if type changed and it became not empty let's check it out we need to reload fighting with browser cache clear now you see our comment disappeared if we set some type it appeared again if we change type it appears again if you clear it hits yes so that's how you can manage visibility and such setting as you can see it's a no code setting so you can make all the settings is your mouse it doesn't require any programming I would like you to see another example so you can also see visibility editability and required property and one more thing which is interesting I think is about selecting values in lookups now we have selection of manager from contact we can display additional columns here for example contact type okay too easy to scroll I would type this now you see some contacts have customer types and contacts have employee type and a finally my contacts list will include many different persons and only some of them will represent my company employees when I want to specify manager here I definitely want to specify someone who is company employee and not just a random contact so I want to make some simple filter here which will help me to select only contacts with a certain type and we can do such filtering with the help of business rows so let's go back to our page go to business rows now I plan to use object level business rows so here you see a realty business rows which means a realty object business rows here was page now here is object level okay and first of all I will check available action here and in comparison with page level we have more options here and I plan to use simple static filter business row static filter will not require any as you can see static filter will not require any special conditions I mean for triggering so it will be applied always that's why it's called static and I will have a column with column I plan to use for filtering this will be manager column and what filter I plan to use I have to specify it with additional condition please note here those of you who use windows home probably you may experience difficulties because it was found that users with windows home experienced troubles opening this tab and it was simply not possible if you use home addition so please be careful when you use this home version and just know about this so this will be temporary not available for you I can make condition here contact type equals to a constant employee so if this this filter will be constantly applied on my lookup save it and then save it again now I save page and I will reload my main tab and you will see how this manager filter will work for us and go back okay let's save changes close reload this reloading is necessary only to work with browser cache let's check now it's tried to select values here you select data now you see only context with employee type okay let's make more examples better examples and let's go to customer 6 to add more contacts to make it representative and let's make a contact name something like James Bond and type will be customer okay one more Bruce Lee will be our employee and Bruce Willis will be also our employee so you will see we have some different contexts different types and let's go back to our reality try to select manager here system only shows us only context with a certain type this is very simple filtering tool as you can see we just used only mouse to set up this type of customization but it's very efficient and that's why I think it's important for you to know about it because even if it doesn't require programming but if you did not attend our customization course you still need to know that such type of filtering is supported also I can quickly show you another filtering of connected fields like filtering cities by countries so or maybe if we focus on us on the for example we can filter filter cities by states but maybe for countries to be more clear and understandable so let's go again to our page in order to filter something by something of course we need to have connected lookups luckily in base product cities and countries are already connected each city has corresponding country reference let me show you cities a lookup already as connections with country let me select fields to display we have names I don't need time zone at all but I want you to see country okay save it now you see a lot of different cities from different countries and it looks like data lookups data in our lookups is already well so let's do such settings I will add two drop-down columns to my page and it will be probably we have to start from country because we point to input data starting from country providing country value and then usr country copy and lookup we will use standard tool for country that is already present with the drop-down list okay and here element go to the osu country related so that's how I add new lookup now I will show you cities lookup so it will be city confirm lookup that will be based on its osu city drop-down list and here we can name something like city it will be enough the most important is uniqueness of this column but city is good enough good unique value for us okay is it okay should be I don't like yeah probably there are limitations about the length of this okay so what we have here is country and city and we need to save it first in order to apply changes to be object-level and so to fully modify our data model properly to take maybe less than a minute for our time okay saved well now we go to business rules so I will show you how we can make an object-level business rule for connected lookups let's add one more lookup action will be apply filter this is a special type of filter which is I think originally designed for connected lookups and we can specify what column to filter obviously we will filter cities by what another column by country and this editor will automatically detect connections between cities and countries so it will show us where city dot country which means country value inside of city lookup equals to value of country provided in our realty page and also automatic settings for clearing when country changed clearing cities when country changed or automatically set country if city was set and for example country was empty empty so you can do this also then country will be automatically populated so this rule will work good for us but what I need to add here is triggering condition we need to change such filter each time when country changes so pages opened or some changes and when country okay we can see that here is filled in then we have to apply this filter so if country changes and becomes filled in then filter should be applied otherwise you may face some glitches in working with this filter sometimes it will work sometimes not so you should not forget about this condition let's save it save page and then we will test it you will see how it works great you see data was successfully saved page saved okay let's test we need to reward it and now let's check it out so let's say Miami and you see country you see city okay country states United States cities as you may see cities are filtered by country you only see cities now hard for frankfort looks like only only US cities I think okay so now you see it looks looks like well okay let's take another example no country you see all cities from different country ararat astrahman Baghdad you see bishkek you see brutiswava so from different countries okay so if you set some city country will be populated automatically in this case but if you clear country city was cleared automatically so if we provide some country like Bangladesh you will see only filtered cities here if you change country to something else like Egypt you will see only Egypt city so filtering works well let's go to our states now we have to search for Seattle yes you see it finds and filter works well so this type of filtering can be done not only for citizen countries for example you can make two connected workups one is type of document and second one is for example subtype and subtype should have a lookup column referencing to corresponding type and in this case when user specifies type it will be technically possible to filter subtypes according to selected type but this canonic example with countries and cities I think it's the easiest to understand example so you can also use it don't forget about business rules triggering by changing country so save it probably that's enough for today and we have one more session tomorrow the two be dedicated to our client side I plan to show you how to make details and also probably answer your questions if you if you ask something about some cases with programming inside of our pages in 3WI later we probably will also invest a bit of time into a QSIC UI examples and I think you'll be interested in migration from QSIC UI to 3WI it will be only client side so objects will be the same I will show you how you can do such migration thank you very much for your time today our session is over in case if you have any questions with your environments with your homework tell me please it's important for me to know do you have any troubles or other notes any questions I have one did we go over I could have just missed this now I could have just been made did we go over the overriding I think it was on the list of the kind of schedule for each day we have parent overriding overriding a parent method did we go over that and I just didn't copy it or is that something we have to go back to you probably ask about something that you already so inquisitive with overriding of methods or this is something else so can you expand the business example no sorry I just saw it on the list on so you know you have the list of the breakdown of each day it was and it's kind of what you open up at the start of each day you mean this one this is yeah yeah so this schedule is a bit outdated unfortunately it's trying to find some time and yes there are some topics that are not so applicable to freedom UI and you may find this something like like alternative JavaScript editors okay I can explain you something and overriding of methods that's it yeah it was possible in classic UI but it looks like fully not supported and not practical in freedom UI in classic UI you could rewrite or interfere into some life cycle stages of page by replacing it's like critically important methods in freedom UI you can write your own methods but system does not allow you to significantly change this life cycle so it looks like I tried and it looks like when you have for example some some handler and you already know that there is a base product handler which is declared somewhere in parent templates you cannot replace it with your own rejecting execution of all parent implementation so in freedom UI you can write your own part and it will be just part of all the steps executed in total and you can't break the way how pages code and what handlers are called there until you will write your own control I think so in freedom UI we have different conditions for programming I plan to update this program for our sessions and it's a bit outdated here but I try to provide you the latest useful material and in the order which looks like the most let's say natural so when you do simple settings then you do a bit more and more complex and so our flow of three topics that we study I think it's quite optimal for current version. It happens that most of our participants watch videos like you now and then they decide to process video files much later than finishing of the sessions so I recommend you to invest some time between the sessions to watch videos and practice because in this case you will easier understand our next topics you will get more experience at the topics and I think it will be in general faster for you so it will be faster boarding faster let's say getting necessary expertise for for you as a developer. This test will require some time for you to prepare so at the end of the sessions next week I will explain you some details how we will prepare for the exam how to be organized and this is optional thing so if you feel confident you may apply for it if not you may use a cad in the website and apply for certification much later so if interested in preparation for the exam also taking keep it in your mind and if you have some questions feel free to ask. Also maybe you will want to write me some messages here is my email I will be happy to answer you and support you during your practicing with examples at our sessions thank you for your time today see you tomorrow as usual and as usual you will receive videos of today's session very soon maybe 40 or 50 minutes to get this video thank you and goodbye see you tomorrow bye",
