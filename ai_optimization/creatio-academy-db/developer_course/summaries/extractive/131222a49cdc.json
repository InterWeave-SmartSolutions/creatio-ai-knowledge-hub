Okay let's start so I need to provide a code you are and I need to explain the business sense of my future process my business sense will include some calculations and also I will work with database so I also plan to connect and to use one example for different purpose and this example will be used not only to demonstrate how you can run C sharp code in creation but also to demonstrate how you can write some code that operates with the creation database and which operates with the creation data model using its own native tools for this. Unfortunately for business processes it's not intended to be so it's not supported and for business process says writing a short code here in this editor in general it's okay so you will not suffer too much by writing just 10 or 20 lines of such code but if your plan includes to run very complex calculations and put in different classes including a lot of other things libraries and tools it makes sense to implement complicated logic separately you can use C-sharp source code for it and then just to create corresponding instances of your classes probably also using tools tool called class factory and you may create instances of classes that will work as helpers for you then you can just make corresponding settings and run corresponding methods. Okay so I will save my code example it's not finished yet I will just show you what happens if you try to save so if you have a changes in your script task and you save your process system asks you to compile here publish means start compilation and I do not plan to do it right now because my code needs some improvement and I need to explain what is going on and explain you step by step what is happening here so in general I need to explain you like common idea of what we are doing the common idea is run a business process which will accept some arguments at the beginning and then we will do calculation of average reality price based on our existing data. So we have to do quite smart filtering we need to take into consideration only records with a certain type in order to split apartments from houses and definitely we have to filter data according to offer type splitting sales from rentals so when we do this average price calculation we will need to have filters or offer type to include only rentals or only sales and general realty type to include only apartments or only houses and then we will calculate total amount of all all selected records total price then we will divide by total area of them in order to include and consider different areas for different objects so we will count in general we will count. Okay so let me explain in general what is happening here I plan to operate with creation database we have two different ways to operate with the database and now I'm using the approach which supports entity data model simply speaking it supports items like objects and respect object structure object. So we need first to select columns also you may ask me if we type this code like this how we know about present functions methods properties and so on we have some academy server side documentation let me show you the canned development dot net classes reference go here and we have set of classes libraries for creation server side you can search for entity schema query class here you will see all of its definitions structures. Currently it looks like a bit boring stuff so we try to go through it quite quickly we only make sure that we have the same columns as we plan to work with and we don't have any obvious road mistakes here so let's look at our reality object just to match our columns we need to select price and it's not going to be a lot of work. Now we consider we getting it with a special get comments from process parameters so we get a couple of good things for type and offer type and then we make filters such filters are made with the create out of this parameter method which I think the most popular method for building filters for entities schema puri and this filter conditions pretty simple column equals value. I plan to work with a global process parameters and we need some of them like real the type ID so we plan to register such parameter as unique identifier code is used inside of programming title can be used for user interface settings in process diagram that's why you spoke.",
