  "summary_text": "So standard simple operations that you may need to work with your data and to organize possibility to read some data for third party app or to make some inserts updates or deletes in creation by comments from other applications. I know I want to show you some additional example, not only just get couple of data values from third party app, but also to show you how you can use no code tools to process collections and to get sets of some data records, how to store it, how to operate with it. So in my case, response parameters can be added manually or we can use special very effective tool, which is called quick setup and I will use example of my response body and give it to system in order to detect what are the possibilities, what are the possible values that we can get out from this example. So what how we can use it we can create a business process, which will run this call service item will get response data, but we need to think of where we went to save set of records with weight and rate information. And so it has a lot of different let's say quite technical purpose which probably will be not necessary for end users so developers used it for one time but now this is an old tool which has its own disadvantages and developers wanted to make something new so they made a new tool called it clear you can find it in GitHub ATF. Common so I will show you the most important the most practical that you may need and after installation we need to tell clear what environments we will work with because clear operates with target website and it needs to know your own login and password so we can use command clear show the bad place. I did not understand the comment and it will show you a list of all supported comments most of comments have their short version and most of parameters have their short version so in order to save your space you can use shorter parameters and the red the bad command is used to register your app so it will be included into this file and then you will refer to it by name this is easier than providing your login and password each time when you need to operate with target environment so let me register my current environment clear. Copy it for you so you will remember it and you will understand why I needed so when I register my app we have some additional travels and both environment places network so we have some travels in exist and app settings JSON okay it was not expected okay show the bad list wow we have some travels in this file line 41 probably because I have some older versions of such settings okay let's go where it tells us users what else users or user update local creation my user update local creation sorry sorry sorry local creation your app settings JSON possibly I have some incorrect settings here or maybe outdated settings all I have something like this which obviously doesn't work good to a good and probably it's a result of some previous stuff it looks like I have some incorrect settings here so okay environments closed then here it's end of environments here is end of all stuff also I could remove my previous items here so I have no environments now let's try to ask it clear show the bad list no troubles you see everything is okay clear read the bad configured correctly okay great so now we can do some simple operations with it clear ping and then we have different options but the easiest way is to use e key for environment and then environment name so this clear ping will physically check availability of our service and if it's okay you will see yellow sorry not yellow green color checks or ping was successful one of the functions that can be useful is restart so you can use restart function restart command clear restart e d1 this is for restart of our app you remember we used maintenance tools add on for this but also you can use this command to perform restart usually it's safe and quite quick you will see what is happening now our application has been restarted it takes up to 10 seconds and sometimes you will need this restart as part of your development process you remember when we modified some objects added new columns we had to restart our app to properly apply such changes so we had such scenarios in our in our training when we needed it and simple log out and log in did not help okay so let's move on we already started to start we have a lot of other comments and clear and you will see plenty of them a lot of comments I will show you the most important ones so from project development point of view you need to know that clear can really help you with saving packages and loading packages so you can use clear to download packages this one this command download packages from source environment for example it can be developer environment and then you can use install package let me find it so we have download and we should have upload push pick a G let me find it should be somewhere here yeah push pick a G it has also short command install I don't know why developers did not show it here install command command is capable so it should be shown here so you see the commentation probably is not perfect and the install command loads our package to target environment this can help us to organize CI CD continuous integration and continues delivery with a single script that can be started with a one step one operation we can do download and then we can install it but also you need to know that create clear has more more other columns sorry comments and some comments like we use for download or install are using standard base product creation of services so system that we work with doesn't require any special setting but if you want to use all power of existing clear comments you must perform special command and this command is named install gate this command downloads from you get and installs in your target system special package which keeps DLL inside and this DLL includes all necessary web services that enable this set of commands so such services simply speaking parts of clear to implement corresponding comments without this comment without install gate without additional package installed to your system clear will be not capable to perform corresponding comments it will show you error 404 which means missing functionality in your target environment so clear only runs web services at your creation and if it fails to run the service that it needs to perform a corresponding comment you will see this error so let's try let's try to run a command to install gate clear install gate ED1 this is required in case if you want to enable full power of clear comments so in my case I will do it in my source environment this takes time because it downloads package from nugget it installs this package into your target environment this package is called clear gate so you will see new package clear gate in your system and this package will have so called file contents and file contents will include compiled class classes for your web services necessary for clear to work but let me show you so here we have configuration section okay it looks like we have some some stuff here let's reward the package, reward configuration section we have some interesting information here I did not expect it it looks like we have some troubles with old data for compilation so system tried to compile and failed exceeded narrow tried count work a process so our IIS prevented our system to compile let me check did I detach of course my visual studio was detached okay I need to look at such questions and also we see some troubles with old data data and probably it's file system will show okay so now system tried to install and compile package named clear gate I should expect to see here no now sort was performed with this case in sensitive sort clear gate is the package which functions may be necessary to run clear comments and you see only couple data items for courses not full stuff so we go to file system go to our application go to our packages clear gate package you see it size five megabyte of executables not so little files been and here here here here and here are DLLs included as file content for this clear gate package so such DLLs are used to execute clear comments they implement the implement web services in those courses into creation server site so that's actually how clear may work on a certain environment and how clear may create and implement new comments because if you want to run something your target system must be able to do this okay so if necessary we can fight with it looks like I have not so much time to date to fix this compilation issue my command to install clear gate package was quite correct so it looks like everything is okay so now I can show you some examples how you can use clear efficient efficiently for project development and this will be comments to save and the world environment settings and sorry save and world packages let me show you I already have another test environment you probably forgot about it so we have D1 Studio as development environment and the second was used as a target and the test environment let's check it out it should be alive so let's go D2 it used as test environment so why it's loaded I can also use clear to register to register a new environment so we will use it here and then we will use it to clear drag the map I need to register D2 and I will call it D2 test to make it clear that it will be my test environment ok register it clear show the bad list my D2 test and clear ping E2 test so I will check availability of my second environment and it looks like should be ok yes looks like ping is ok here is my second environment so my plan is to show you the most useful usage of clear for project development this is CICD automation for saving and loading of packages I already have examples of scripts that perform this save and load so let's take this one probably clear download so we can download set of packages let's check out how many source packages we have so we have dev classic then we have us are realty and also we have us are a realty migration so we have three packages here us are realty migration and source environment is D1 so clear download is the same as clear pool pkg command and we can download set of packages not only one but several packages from source environment destination path is somewhere like this get it dev ok we did the May 2024 so we will finally have a result of a zip file including all our packages we can use this zip file into next command which will be used for loading clear install the same as clear pool push pkg we will use source file we will use on target environment D2 test and we need to use logs because it's important to see some technical details so I will share such comments for save and load with you so it will be really important for you if you want to practice with it and now let's let's check out how it works we will remove unnecessary examples and this will be my save and load example of CIICD let's try first system will save three packages into gz files organize into one single zip file and then it will be done and as you can see it makes it as a one operation if you do save manually saving of an app or saving of a separate package so you will have to perform it with separate steps as you can see it went but not so fully correctly I will remove unnecessary files from my example it's 7 apriol so here is our saved zip file so it looks like save part went okay and the main part looks like I had a couple of exceptions here so you see we have a location package with more file descriptor more than one file app descriptor gson what it is what package it's about real to migration no I don't know so something wrong with application descriptors we can check it at our file system probably it's a result of something messing with package dependencies so our realty has its own information of app descriptor yes this is realty app okay realty migration has its own app descriptor yes and our dev classic should have no dependencies from existing realty stuff and it should have all we have a descriptor extension something strange here and it looks like probably system failed to work with it but it looks like it's not a big trouble and you see one more issue here parents schema and was not found yes this is more serious trouble because it looks like our target environment was not fully prepared to install our changes because it missed customer 360 app possibly previous error message that we had here previous message with this stuff here probably it was also missing corresponding app and we used so our solution expects that target system will have customer 360 in my example customers current our target environment did not have customers 360 that's why we have this stuff so in order to fix it of course we have to install customers 360 first and then our solution next in this case it will be loaded fully correctly but now we can test our target environment so usually we need to reload it we can find our items like oh we don't have any probably it did not like it okay we have to install customer 360 here and then load our solution so you see only the classic was loaded here and recent stuff was not loaded okay let's try to install customers 360 install continue I did not enable file system development mode here because it's like a test environment and no any creation no any external ID so it's installed I install customer 360 then I can try to load my settings again that's how we will see our working examples so I will add when to show you fully correct transition of my environments this is customer 360 installation on my target system as you can see previous results of manual load of package manual load can be done with new application and then install from file now we have successful installation great if you're the lot we will see customer 360 up added yes customer 360 was added now we can try to install our stuff one more time here let's remove previous package and one more thing before we continue so this is not so obvious but when we developed C sharp sources we used external editors we have C sharp code saved on disk only and in order to make everything correct we need to download all items that we developed manually inside of our embedded editors back to disk and then we have to upload changes from disk this is very important because our database part of C sharp sources may have all the C sharp source and if we ever try to compile our package on target environment we may have very unpleasant situation when we will try to compile old contents of C sharp sources instead of actual one so in order to make correct export of your solution to test and production we need to save everything on disk then we have to take everything from disk update packages from file system now you will see system will show us differences in C sharp code because both examples were written here and here were written with the help of external editors this is very important now our system is ready to export so let's do this again save and load thank you Adrien for your time yes we are almost over we will continue tomorrow with preparation for developer axon and also answer your questions it will be not so hard and thank you for a time so now I just want to make it correctly with save and load and then if everything goes well we will see our apps we will see our functionality loaded to our target environment if something goes not as planned this is also good because we will see some exceptions you will see how we can travel shoot them it's important to understand how you may do some fixes when your package is not installed as you plan now you can see do we have any errors yes we had some errors here and it's interesting because it should not be so we should not have any issues here possibly it's about data let me check here we have a log file and we have data insert issue so C-smodule entity usr reality no then this module in workplace studio so violation of primary key it's because of data binding which does not keep correct ideas but duplicate keys is module in workplace so it's registered in a section in a workplace and this duplicate is possible because of the way how data binding saves it so we have one data item failed to load but in general okay one more data item failed to load so we have only troubles in couple of data items but in general data was loaded so we have as a result some errors but this is because of something is not exactly the same as our original stuff okay let's try to reward our section let's see do we have anything loaded studio my applications we have real to section we have classic we miss real to sections here because such data items were not loaded I will show you how you can fix it let's go to advanced settings let's find our new packages loaded here so we can search for real team a realty package and we can see couple of data items so let's see only status has error or needs to actualize here here so you can see list of items that were failed to install couple of escrow scripts from base product we don't care and only one item in our realty package was not loaded we can see error message text and properties so violation of primary key it looks like system can't find the correct value of what it's hard to see okay let's see so it can't find correct duplicate value of this module in workplace it looks like we already have this module in workplace ID and it looks like this data entity was not good so we have some items here and we have key which was not ID and key was used by section and workplace so we can fix this it's not good and this is behavior made by data binding tool I don't really like it so we can fix it with the another data item organizing key by ID that will prevent the data from inserting twice with the same idea so we can fix it let me show you this is module in workplace and studio so it's our realty section this is a date data item this module in workplace for studio and such settings for key is not good ID key is better position for update if in case a record was found great and we can save it and we have a lot of warnings but it's about existing date so it's actual as it's save it just a lot of warnings about reorganizing of the same existence sections that already present in data and also one more thing which we potentially have the same troubles is module in workplace for this realty and it's 26 my application also it makes sense to our ID is already set here okay great probably it can't put position for updates so let's data save it great everything is okay so we fixed it we have to save everything on file system just to make sure we will correctly have all the data well in our repository version control so now you will see that it's possible to save and vote packages again we can prepare something like older like v1 plus old file now we will have a bit better version of it okay saved now let's try to run this transport again so it will be final one and this is example how you can automate delivery of your changes how you can take data from the developer environment and automatically save and the vote it to some other task target test environment of course as developer you understand that sometimes things are not going very smoothly sometimes we have unexpected errors and having such errors during the training is also good because it helps us to see how you can troubleshoot how you should search for error details and how you should do all changes so now you see next time we loaded it took significantly less time because water is smart water text takes zip file takes information about its items all the packages all the items of configuration and it analyzes date of modification if date of modification of the loaded item is the same as date of modification of items that you have already in your target environment then it just keeps it and that's why if you have a big big solution but you have tiny small changes there from recent upload that you did previously it will only analyze changed items when loaded on target environment and final total installation time will be small and now you see only couple of data items that were failed were now updated and fully applied and everything else was correct so now our system in our target environment has no errors as a result of installation we can go to all packages to see items in the actual only base product stuff okay don't care no errors okay so our package with reality was fully correctly loaded all the items that we have were loaded well and we can test it at our user interface so you can go to corresponding sections you can try to create data records you see all three actions all three sections here so our reality with columns you can create new data so finally cat here and you see now we have default values working we have some test data test price negative price validation works two big price will also work and system will not allow us to save because of server site okay like this but now you see prices more than one billion so everything is working as expected so that's how you can deliver your solution to test and check it out and perform corresponding full scale test for your system to check out works now you see details were filled in so everything works quite well and that's how you can do some automation is clear clear has also a lot of interesting other comments I will show you just one of them clear SQL select name for contact okay something like this so this is example for clear SQL execution sometimes when you work in cloud with cloud environments you just can't connect to the database directly and operate with it so sometimes you need to run some simple select queries in database to make sure you have specific data and that's how you can do it with your clear so this is example of how you can read list of contacts from your database of course your queries could be much more complicated and when you run SQL purists please be extremely careful because SQL SQL statements is the way how you can easily damage your system how you can easily destroy your database or you should be extremely careful and please check your queries before execution. SQL can really help you and to see some data directly unfortunately creation has no tools to work with SQL easily from user interface now previously we had such too but was designed by some Russian partner and as you remember you know creation give ups any any work with Russian or be Russian partners and customers so we also removed all the questions that are add-ons from the marketplace and that's why now we don't have any fancy good looking tool to run SQL query from application user interface but now this is something that you can do and the last information that you need to know about Clio is that it's also possible to use add-on for visual studio named Clio Explorer Clio Explorer is an add-on that you can use in visual studio code it automatically loads your information from file with connections for existing solutions and you can use a lot of Clio commands from user interface including SQL. Oh D1 I already connected probably connected yes what's wrong there split editor more actions oh open this yes it was case sensitive I don't know why it's case sensitive but now you see some data we got from the database and you have some kind of UI stuff but with the help of Clio Explorer Clio Explorer uses installed Clio tool so without Clio installed it will not work but this is user interface feature which can help you to work with a particular environment.",
