[00:39] screen now
[00:39] screen now is i have navigated to creatio
[00:42] is i have navigated to creatio
[00:42] is i have navigated to creatio or i've navigated to academy
[00:44] or i've navigated to academy
[00:44] or i've navigated to academy creation.com and i went into a
[00:46] creation.com and i went into a
[00:46] creation.com and i went into a documentation section so if you just
[00:47] documentation section so if you just
[00:47] documentation section so if you just simply click on this documentation

[01:05] you will find a way to deploy here is a
[01:05] you will find a way to deploy here is a link that will follow and in this case
[01:07] link that will follow and in this case
[01:07] link that will follow and in this case we're going to be following on-site
[01:08] we're going to be following on-site
[01:08] we're going to be following on-site deployment instructions
[01:10] deployment instructions
[01:10] deployment instructions now there are a couple of instructions
[01:12] now there are a couple of instructions
[01:12] now there are a couple of instructions or is the documentation is broken down
[01:15] or is the documentation is broken down
[01:15] or is the documentation is broken down into multiple sections
[01:17] into multiple sections
[01:17] into multiple sections just to make it a little bit easier so
[01:18] just to make it a little bit easier so
[01:18] just to make it a little bit easier so we're going to cover one by one
[01:21] we're going to cover one by one
[01:21] we're going to cover one by one let's start off with system requirements
[01:24] let's start off with system requirements
[01:24] let's start off with system requirements system requirements broken down into
[01:26] system requirements broken down into
[01:26] system requirements broken down into client and server side and client will
[01:28] client and server side and client will
[01:28] client and server side and client will skip for now but essentially
[01:29] skip for now but essentially
[01:30] skip for now but essentially you need to make sure that you have a
[01:31] you need to make sure that you have a
[01:31] you need to make sure that you have a modern browser now
[01:33] modern browser now
[01:33] modern browser now in here in system requirements this is
[01:35] in here in system requirements this is
[01:35] in here in system requirements this is where the more difficult part starts
[01:38] where the more difficult part starts
[01:38] where the more difficult part starts the article goes into details explaining
[01:40] the article goes into details explaining
[01:40] the article goes into details explaining various possible installation options
[01:43] various possible installation options
[01:43] various possible installation options and it's listing uh some deployment
[01:45] and it's listing uh some deployment
[01:45] and it's listing uh some deployment ideas here where you have
[01:47] ideas here where you have
[01:47] ideas here where you have dotnet application or iis is server
[01:51] dotnet application or iis is server
[01:51] dotnet application or iis is server you've got a database could be ms sql it
[01:54] you've got a database could be ms sql it
[01:54] you've got a database could be ms sql it could be a postgrad
[01:55] could be a postgrad
[01:55] could be a postgrad it could be oracle and a third component
[01:58] it could be oracle and a third component
[01:58] it could be oracle and a third component a minimum component
[01:59] a minimum component
[01:59] a minimum component redis and this constitutes a minimum
[02:02] redis and this constitutes a minimum
[02:02] redis and this constitutes a minimum required
[02:03] required
[02:03] required components that are necessary to run
[02:06] components that are necessary to run
[02:06] components that are necessary to run creation
[02:07] creation
[02:07] creation so redis iis and a database of your
[02:10] so redis iis and a database of your
[02:10] so redis iis and a database of your choice
[02:11] choice
[02:11] choice there are more difficult and more
[02:13] there are more difficult and more
[02:13] there are more difficult and more challenging
[02:14] challenging
[02:14] challenging installations for example when you want
[02:16] installations for example when you want
[02:16] installations for example when you want to go in the farm when you want to go
[02:19] to go in the farm when you want to go
[02:19] to go in the farm when you want to go load balancer when you want to run redis
[02:21] load balancer when you want to run redis
[02:21] load balancer when you want to run redis in the cluster
[02:22] in the cluster
[02:22] in the cluster you can configure your installation in
[02:24] you can configure your installation in
[02:24] you can configure your installation in that way but for our purposes for today
[02:27] that way but for our purposes for today
[02:27] that way but for our purposes for today for simple development machine
[02:28] for simple development machine
[02:28] for simple development machine pre-production
[02:29] pre-production
[02:29] pre-production we're not going to be going with the
[02:31] we're not going to be going with the
[02:31] we're not going to be going with the installation of farm as it's fairly
[02:33] installation of farm as it's fairly
[02:33] installation of farm as it's fairly technical and it's fairly specific to
[02:35] technical and it's fairly specific to
[02:35] technical and it's fairly specific to your particular application
[02:38] your particular application
[02:38] your particular application so let's scroll down and see what we
[02:39] so let's scroll down and see what we
[02:39] so let's scroll down and see what we need to do there's a lot of text here
[02:41] need to do there's a lot of text here
[02:41] need to do there's a lot of text here but i'm just going to take you to the
[02:43] but i'm just going to take you to the
[02:43] but i'm just going to take you to the most interesting parts
[02:45] most interesting parts
[02:45] most interesting parts the first part is we need to make sure
[02:47] the first part is we need to make sure
[02:47] the first part is we need to make sure that our servers or the underlying os
[02:49] that our servers or the underlying os
[02:50] that our servers or the underlying os that we want to install is supported now
[02:52] that we want to install is supported now
[02:52] that we want to install is supported now here we see that the
[02:54] here we see that the
[02:54] here we see that the server windows server 2012 and up are
[02:56] server windows server 2012 and up are
[02:56] server windows server 2012 and up are supported however
[02:58] supported however
[02:58] supported however windows 10 is also supported now in our
[03:01] windows 10 is also supported now in our
[03:01] windows 10 is also supported now in our example today i will be using windows 10
[03:03] example today i will be using windows 10
[03:03] example today i will be using windows 10 machine for the deployment but you could
[03:05] machine for the deployment but you could
[03:05] machine for the deployment but you could use
[03:06] use
[03:06] use windows 10 i believe even earlier
[03:08] windows 10 i believe even earlier
[03:08] windows 10 i believe even earlier versions will also work if you
[03:10] versions will also work if you
[03:10] versions will also work if you run them now we can install it on linux
[03:13] run them now we can install it on linux
[03:13] run them now we can install it on linux in debian but we're not going to be
[03:15] in debian but we're not going to be
[03:15] in debian but we're not going to be using it
[03:16] using it
[03:16] using it for now most of the people will be
[03:18] for now most of the people will be
[03:18] for now most of the people will be installing it on linux on
[03:19] installing it on linux on
[03:19] installing it on linux on on windows not on linux and so we're
[03:22] on windows not on linux and so we're
[03:22] on windows not on linux and so we're going to address
[03:23] going to address
[03:23] going to address this part first in order for us to
[03:26] this part first in order for us to
[03:26] this part first in order for us to deploy
[03:28] deploy
[03:28] deploy creation we need to first make sure that
[03:29] creation we need to first make sure that
[03:29] creation we need to first make sure that our windows machine complies with all
[03:32] our windows machine complies with all
[03:32] our windows machine complies with all the
[03:32] the
[03:32] the requirements so let's go into uh
[03:35] requirements so let's go into uh
[03:35] requirements so let's go into uh deploying creation.net framework
[03:37] deploying creation.net framework
[03:38] deploying creation.net framework application on windows let's follow this
[03:39] application on windows let's follow this
[03:39] application on windows let's follow this link
[03:40] link
[03:40] link when we follow this link we'll see that
[03:43] when we follow this link we'll see that
[03:43] when we follow this link we'll see that some requirements
[03:44] some requirements
[03:44] some requirements or some packages we need to install we
[03:46] or some packages we need to install we
[03:46] or some packages we need to install we need to make sure that we install
[03:48] need to make sure that we install
[03:48] need to make sure that we install net core sdk 3.1 and that we install
[03:51] net core sdk 3.1 and that we install
[03:51] net core sdk 3.1 and that we install framework sdk472
[03:54] framework sdk472
[03:54] framework sdk472 this will be required for our
[03:56] this will be required for our
[03:56] this will be required for our application server to compile your
[03:58] application server to compile your
[03:58] application server to compile your source code or to compile the
[03:59] source code or to compile the
[03:59] source code or to compile the application do many
[04:01] application do many
[04:01] application do many many tasks that we when we run wizards
[04:04] many tasks that we when we run wizards
[04:04] many tasks that we when we run wizards etc
[04:05] etc
[04:05] etc now there's also a bunch of requirements
[04:07] now there's also a bunch of requirements
[04:07] now there's also a bunch of requirements here on the windows component side
[04:09] here on the windows component side
[04:09] here on the windows component side and this is what we're going to
[04:10] and this is what we're going to
[04:10] and this is what we're going to concentrate on now if you need to
[04:13] concentrate on now if you need to
[04:13] concentrate on now if you need to download your sdks just make sure you
[04:14] download your sdks just make sure you
[04:14] download your sdks just make sure you follow the link and
[04:16] follow the link and
[04:16] follow the link and click through the installation guide
[04:17] click through the installation guide
[04:17] click through the installation guide provided by microsoft
[04:19] provided by microsoft
[04:19] provided by microsoft and these sdks will be installed most
[04:21] and these sdks will be installed most
[04:22] and these sdks will be installed most likely your machine will need to be
[04:23] likely your machine will need to be
[04:23] likely your machine will need to be restarted or rebooted at least once when
[04:25] restarted or rebooted at least once when
[04:25] restarted or rebooted at least once when you're installing it so please take some
[04:27] you're installing it so please take some
[04:27] you're installing it so please take some time
[04:28] time
[04:28] time there's also another dot net core is
[04:30] there's also another dot net core is
[04:30] there's also another dot net core is decade that is required if you
[04:32] decade that is required if you
[04:32] decade that is required if you want to run identity service you need
[04:35] want to run identity service you need
[04:35] want to run identity service you need dotnet core
[04:36] dotnet core
[04:36] dotnet core 2.2 so you're also going to have to go
[04:38] 2.2 so you're also going to have to go
[04:38] 2.2 so you're also going to have to go and install it and i'll show you
[04:40] and install it and i'll show you
[04:40] and install it and i'll show you how to do that later in this tutorial
[04:44] how to do that later in this tutorial
[04:44] how to do that later in this tutorial and here we see that the windows 10 is
[04:46] and here we see that the windows 10 is
[04:46] and here we see that the windows 10 is not
[04:47] not
[04:47] not a production grade os and yet
[04:50] a production grade os and yet
[04:50] a production grade os and yet it's still supported so let's take a
[04:53] it's still supported so let's take a
[04:53] it's still supported so let's take a look at these common features and let's
[04:54] look at these common features and let's
[04:54] look at these common features and let's take a look at the components that
[04:56] take a look at the components that
[04:56] take a look at the components that windows machine needs to have installed
[04:58] windows machine needs to have installed
[04:58] windows machine needs to have installed prior to trying to or attempting to
[05:00] prior to trying to or attempting to
[05:00] prior to trying to or attempting to install creation
[05:02] install creation
[05:02] install creation so on the left hand side the features
[05:05] so on the left hand side the features
[05:05] so on the left hand side the features are broken down into
[05:06] are broken down into
[05:06] are broken down into the related components into groups and
[05:09] the related components into groups and
[05:09] the related components into groups and on the right hand side
[05:10] on the right hand side
[05:10] on the right hand side is the name of the component itself in
[05:12] is the name of the component itself in
[05:12] is the name of the component itself in order for you to install these
[05:13] order for you to install these
[05:13] order for you to install these components you need to navigate to
[05:15] components you need to navigate to
[05:15] components you need to navigate to control panel and
[05:16] control panel and
[05:16] control panel and activate them this is what i'm going to
[05:18] activate them this is what i'm going to
[05:18] activate them this is what i'm going to do so on my windows machine i'll just
[05:21] do so on my windows machine i'll just
[05:21] do so on my windows machine i'll just press start button and say control panel
[05:23] press start button and say control panel
[05:23] press start button and say control panel and go to my control panel
[05:25] and go to my control panel
[05:25] and go to my control panel and here we can go inside the programs
[05:27] and here we can go inside the programs
[05:27] and here we can go inside the programs and in the middle there is going to be
[05:29] and in the middle there is going to be
[05:29] and in the middle there is going to be turn
[05:29] turn
[05:29] turn windows features on and off this is the
[05:32] windows features on and off this is the
[05:32] windows features on and off this is the screen that we want to get to
[05:34] screen that we want to get to
[05:34] screen that we want to get to now depending on what you already have
[05:35] now depending on what you already have
[05:35] now depending on what you already have installed or what rights you have on
[05:37] installed or what rights you have on
[05:37] installed or what rights you have on your machine you may
[05:39] your machine you may
[05:39] your machine you may have some of these components installed
[05:41] have some of these components installed
[05:41] have some of these components installed make sure that your
[05:43] make sure that your
[05:43] make sure that your sdks.netcore.net frameworks are
[05:45] sdks.netcore.net frameworks are
[05:45] sdks.netcore.net frameworks are previously installed otherwise you will
[05:46] previously installed otherwise you will
[05:46] previously installed otherwise you will not be able to see these two checkboxes
[05:50] not be able to see these two checkboxes
[05:50] not be able to see these two checkboxes now it's time for me to install these
[05:52] now it's time for me to install these
[05:52] now it's time for me to install these components the installation is fairly
[05:54] components the installation is fairly
[05:54] components the installation is fairly straightforward as all you need to do is
[05:56] straightforward as all you need to do is
[05:56] straightforward as all you need to do is just simply find the component which is
[05:57] just simply find the component which is
[05:57] just simply find the component which is the most challenging part
[05:59] the most challenging part
[05:59] the most challenging part and then put a checkbox next to it so
[06:01] and then put a checkbox next to it so
[06:01] and then put a checkbox next to it so let's start off with this common http

[07:22] for xp for windows 10. now that we have installed all the
[07:23] now that we have installed all the
[07:23] now that we have installed all the necessary components it's time for us to
[07:25] necessary components it's time for us to
[07:25] necessary components it's time for us to move on to the installation of the
[07:27] move on to the installation of the
[07:27] move on to the installation of the actual
[07:28] actual
[07:28] actual application i've already downloaded
[07:32] application i've already downloaded
[07:32] application i've already downloaded the application you can take it wherever
[07:34] the application you can take it wherever
[07:34] the application you can take it wherever you are taking the
[07:35] you are taking the
[07:35] you are taking the uh the components of the application and
[07:38] uh the components of the application and
[07:38] uh the components of the application and what i'm going to do is
[07:39] what i'm going to do is
[07:39] what i'm going to do is i i've gotten the zip file that
[07:42] i i've gotten the zip file that
[07:42] i i've gotten the zip file that essentially contains everything that i
[07:43] essentially contains everything that i
[07:43] essentially contains everything that i need the backup to my database etc
[07:46] need the backup to my database etc
[07:46] need the backup to my database etc and i'm going to simply extract it here
[07:49] and i'm going to simply extract it here
[07:49] and i'm going to simply extract it here now i have a program called 7zip that
[07:52] now i have a program called 7zip that
[07:52] now i have a program called 7zip that allows me to
[07:54] allows me to
[07:54] allows me to to unzip files a little bit faster so
[07:57] to unzip files a little bit faster so
[07:57] to unzip files a little bit faster so i'm going to use
[07:57] i'm going to use
[07:58] i'm going to use 7-zip to extract files now i can extract
[08:01] 7-zip to extract files now i can extract
[08:01] 7-zip to extract files now i can extract files to a particular directory which is
[08:02] files to a particular directory which is
[08:02] files to a particular directory which is what i'm intending to do
[08:04] what i'm intending to do
[08:04] what i'm intending to do or you can just simply dump them in the
[08:06] or you can just simply dump them in the
[08:06] or you can just simply dump them in the entire directory
[08:08] entire directory
[08:08] entire directory okay so now that my installation or that
[08:11] okay so now that my installation or that
[08:12] okay so now that my installation or that my extraction is completed it's time for
[08:14] my extraction is completed it's time for
[08:14] my extraction is completed it's time for us to start playing around with that
[08:15] us to start playing around with that
[08:15] us to start playing around with that various components
[08:17] various components
[08:17] various components now i have some components installed as
[08:19] now i have some components installed as
[08:19] now i have some components installed as part of the infrastructure inside docker
[08:21] part of the infrastructure inside docker
[08:21] part of the infrastructure inside docker container

[08:42] however many people do and if you want
[08:42] however many people do and if you want to do so just google for
[08:44] to do so just google for
[08:44] to do so just google for redis for windows and there's going to
[08:45] redis for windows and there's going to
[08:46] redis for windows and there's going to be an msi file that you can just
[08:47] be an msi file that you can just
[08:48] be an msi file that you can just just install and becomes one of the
[08:50] just install and becomes one of the

[08:54] docker and i will provide you with all the necessary docker compose files
[08:56] all the necessary docker compose files
[08:56] all the necessary docker compose files so you can restore this infrastructure
[08:58] so you can restore this infrastructure
[08:58] so you can restore this infrastructure on your own machine now that i have my
[09:02] on your own machine now that i have my
[09:02] on your own machine now that i have my installation directory unzipped
[09:05] installation directory unzipped
[09:05] installation directory unzipped i can take a look at what's inside we'll
[09:08] i can take a look at what's inside we'll
[09:08] i can take a look at what's inside we'll find a bunch of files bunch of
[09:09] find a bunch of files bunch of
[09:09] find a bunch of files bunch of directories
[09:11] directories
[09:11] directories and one of them is going to be identity
[09:13] and one of them is going to be identity
[09:13] and one of them is going to be identity service we will be installing later
[09:15] service we will be installing later
[09:15] service we will be installing later there is going to be a connection string
[09:16] there is going to be a connection string
[09:16] there is going to be a connection string file where we have to specify how to

[09:18] file where we have to specify how to connect to the underlying databases
[09:20] connect to the underlying databases
[09:20] connect to the underlying databases and there is going to be idb folder the
[09:23] and there is going to be idb folder the
[09:23] and there is going to be idb folder the b folder here contains a backup
[09:25] b folder here contains a backup
[09:26] b folder here contains a backup to mssql in my case i'm installing a
[09:28] to mssql in my case i'm installing a
[09:28] to mssql in my case i'm installing a mess sql
[09:29] mess sql
[09:29] mess sql but the procedure for postgrad is very
[09:31] but the procedure for postgrad is very
[09:31] but the procedure for postgrad is very similar it's going to contain a backup
[09:33] similar it's going to contain a backup
[09:33] similar it's going to contain a backup file that we will use to restore
[09:36] file that we will use to restore
[09:36] file that we will use to restore the database the next thing we need to
[09:38] the database the next thing we need to
[09:38] the database the next thing we need to do is we need to actually use this
[09:40] do is we need to actually use this
[09:40] do is we need to actually use this directory and put it in a place where we
[09:42] directory and put it in a place where we
[09:42] directory and put it in a place where we can
[09:43] can
[09:43] can bring up a website so in order for me to
[09:45] bring up a website so in order for me to
[09:46] bring up a website so in order for me to do that
[09:46] do that
[09:46] do that i'm going to be using my iis now is
[09:49] i'm going to be using my iis now is
[09:49] i'm going to be using my iis now is what's going to
[09:49] what's going to
[09:50] what's going to run the application and currently i have
[09:52] run the application and currently i have
[09:52] run the application and currently i have some applications already installed here
[09:54] some applications already installed here
[09:54] some applications already installed here but i will have them turned off as you
[09:56] but i will have them turned off as you
[09:56] but i will have them turned off as you can tell that i have already some
[09:58] can tell that i have already some
[09:58] can tell that i have already some samples installed here
[09:59] samples installed here
[09:59] samples installed here but they are all deactivated
[10:02] but they are all deactivated
[10:02] but they are all deactivated now by default i prefer to install my
[10:04] now by default i prefer to install my
[10:04] now by default i prefer to install my applications in a particular space on
[10:06] applications in a particular space on
[10:06] applications in a particular space on the disk and that's going to be under
[10:08] the disk and that's going to be under
[10:08] the disk and that's going to be under in that pub www and then
[10:11] in that pub www and then
[10:11] in that pub www and then all my applications are going to end up
[10:13] all my applications are going to end up
[10:13] all my applications are going to end up here now the reason i choose to install
[10:15] here now the reason i choose to install
[10:16] here now the reason i choose to install it in this particular four
[10:17] it in this particular four
[10:17] it in this particular four folders because this folder by default
[10:19] folders because this folder by default
[10:19] folders because this folder by default is where iis
[10:20] is where iis
[10:20] is where iis wants to look for all the files and
[10:22] wants to look for all the files and
[10:22] wants to look for all the files and there aren't going to be any permissions
[10:23] there aren't going to be any permissions
[10:23] there aren't going to be any permissions issues
[10:24] issues
[10:24] issues now if you want to install it in some
[10:26] now if you want to install it in some
[10:26] now if you want to install it in some other directory you need to make sure
[10:27] other directory you need to make sure
[10:27] other directory you need to make sure that you give proper permissions for the
[10:29] that you give proper permissions for the
[10:29] that you give proper permissions for the iis user to execute
[10:31] iis user to execute
[10:31] iis user to execute against that directory you can do that
[10:34] against that directory you can do that
[10:34] against that directory you can do that quite easily so let's create
[10:35] quite easily so let's create
[10:35] quite easily so let's create a new directory creatio
[10:39] a new directory creatio
[10:39] a new directory creatio demo oops demo
[10:43] demo oops demo
[10:43] demo oops demo and if i want to install it let's say
[10:45] and if i want to install it let's say
[10:45] and if i want to install it let's say inside this directory and i want to
[10:46] inside this directory and i want to
[10:46] inside this directory and i want to point
[10:47] point
[10:47] point iis to work in this directory i need to
[10:48] iis to work in this directory i need to
[10:48] iis to work in this directory i need to make sure that the iis
[10:50] make sure that the iis
[10:50] make sure that the iis user has the necessary permissions i'll
[10:53] user has the necessary permissions i'll
[10:53] user has the necessary permissions i'll right click properties on the directory
[10:55] right click properties on the directory
[10:55] right click properties on the directory i'll go into my security and i'll make
[10:57] i'll go into my security and i'll make
[10:57] i'll go into my security and i'll make sure that the user
[10:59] sure that the user
[10:59] sure that the user is actually has permissions so let's go
[11:01] is actually has permissions so let's go
[11:01] is actually has permissions so let's go here under
[11:03] here under
[11:03] here under edit i believe and let's add a new user
[11:06] edit i believe and let's add a new user
[11:06] edit i believe and let's add a new user it's going to be ias is you
[11:09] it's going to be ias is you
[11:09] it's going to be ias is you i saw i believe let's check names
[11:14] i saw i believe let's check names
[11:14] i saw i believe let's check names hopefully it picks it up if it doesn't
[11:18] hopefully it picks it up if it doesn't
[11:18] hopefully it picks it up if it doesn't i you sr something like this
[11:34] no not in the domain in my machine
[11:34] no not in the domain in my machine and object type
[11:41] this is probably the hardest part i
[11:41] this is probably the hardest part i can't find them
[11:43] can't find them
[11:43] can't find them let's go on the advanced
[11:50] and in here we can start with searches
[11:50] and in here we can start with searches find now but what am i looking for
[11:53] find now but what am i looking for
[11:53] find now but what am i looking for let's start find now and i s
[11:56] let's start find now and i s
[11:56] let's start find now and i s here that's the one that i want so this
[11:58] here that's the one that i want so this
[11:58] here that's the one that i want so this is the user that i want to
[12:00] is the user that i want to
[12:00] is the user that i want to know again didn't get it right
[12:04] know again didn't get it right

[12:07] sorry let's do it again this is the one that i want
[12:07] that i want
[12:08] that i want is iusrs so just a weird name
[12:11] is iusrs so just a weird name
[12:11] is iusrs so just a weird name but you just have to make sure that you
[12:13] but you just have to make sure that you
[12:13] but you just have to make sure that you find this uh
[12:15] find this uh
[12:15] find this uh find this user okay so now that i've
[12:17] find this user okay so now that i've
[12:17] find this user okay so now that i've selected this user to have access to
[12:19] selected this user to have access to
[12:19] selected this user to have access to this directory i also want to make sure
[12:21] this directory i also want to make sure
[12:21] this directory i also want to make sure that i
[12:21] that i

[12:38] okay and now we can click apply and we
[12:38] okay and now we can click apply and we can click
[12:38] can click
[12:38] can click on ok now in some machines where you do
[12:41] on ok now in some machines where you do
[12:41] on ok now in some machines where you do not have administrative access that
[12:43] not have administrative access that
[12:43] not have administrative access that would be a problematic issue
[12:45] would be a problematic issue

[13:17] folder and the next thing i want to do is i want to make sure that
[13:18] is i want to make sure that
[13:18] is i want to make sure that i copy the content of our zip folder
[13:21] i copy the content of our zip folder
[13:21] i copy the content of our zip folder inside this directory
[13:23] inside this directory
[13:23] inside this directory so let's go back into our previously
[13:25] so let's go back into our previously
[13:26] so let's go back into our previously extracted directory
[13:27] extracted directory
[13:27] extracted directory and just copy the whole thing and i'll
[13:29] and just copy the whole thing and i'll
[13:30] and just copy the whole thing and i'll use control x to
[13:31] use control x to
[13:31] use control x to cut and i'm going to paste it into this
[13:34] cut and i'm going to paste it into this
[13:34] cut and i'm going to paste it into this directory
[13:35] directory
[13:35] directory now after having pasted everything back
[13:38] now after having pasted everything back
[13:38] now after having pasted everything back into
[13:38] into
[13:38] into this drive the next thing that we're
[13:40] this drive the next thing that we're
[13:40] this drive the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to try to
[13:42] going to do is we're going to try to
[13:42] going to do is we're going to try to create
[13:42] create
[13:42] create with the help of iis we're going to try
[13:44] with the help of iis we're going to try
[13:44] with the help of iis we're going to try to create a website and the application
[13:47] to create a website and the application
[13:47] to create a website and the application pool
[13:53] let's open our is manager and
[13:53] let's open our is manager and in here i have some sites and some
[13:55] in here i have some sites and some
[13:55] in here i have some sites and some application pools but they're all
[13:56] application pools but they're all
[13:56] application pools but they're all stopped as you could tell so let's
[13:58] stopped as you could tell so let's
[13:58] stopped as you could tell so let's create a new one we'll add a website
[14:00] create a new one we'll add a website
[14:00] create a new one we'll add a website let's give it a name so i'm going to
[14:02] let's give it a name so i'm going to
[14:02] let's give it a name so i'm going to call it stu
[14:04] call it stu
[14:04] call it stu creatio studio
[14:07] creatio studio
[14:07] creatio studio and let's give it a path to the folder
[14:10] and let's give it a path to the folder
[14:10] and let's give it a path to the folder that we have
[14:11] that we have
[14:11] that we have extracted our director our product in
[14:14] extracted our director our product in
[14:14] extracted our director our product in so creation demo now we can specify
[14:17] so creation demo now we can specify
[14:18] so creation demo now we can specify we have to specify a port i'm going to
[14:20] we have to specify a port i'm going to
[14:20] we have to specify a port i'm going to i'm going to pick 7010
[14:21] i'm going to pick 7010
[14:22] i'm going to pick 7010 any port will do 82 85 80 whatever the
[14:25] any port will do 82 85 80 whatever the
[14:25] any port will do 82 85 80 whatever the case might be
[14:26] case might be
[14:26] case might be just make sure that this port is not
[14:28] just make sure that this port is not
[14:28] just make sure that this port is not occupied by anything else
[14:30] occupied by anything else
[14:30] occupied by anything else the host name i'm going to specify is my
[14:31] the host name i'm going to specify is my
[14:32] the host name i'm going to specify is my own local host name
[14:33] own local host name
[14:33] own local host name this is the name of my machine if you
[14:35] this is the name of my machine if you
[14:35] this is the name of my machine if you want to find out what your
[14:37] want to find out what your
[14:37] want to find out what your machine name is just open your console
[14:39] machine name is just open your console
[14:39] machine name is just open your console and type in host
[14:41] and type in host
[14:41] and type in host name as one word and you will know what
[14:43] name as one word and you will know what
[14:43] name as one word and you will know what your host name is
[14:45] your host name is
[14:45] your host name is now the only reason i'm doing it is just
[14:46] now the only reason i'm doing it is just
[14:46] now the only reason i'm doing it is just because i'm addressing this machine from
[14:48] because i'm addressing this machine from
[14:48] because i'm addressing this machine from other applications by this
[14:49] other applications by this
[14:49] other applications by this host name so it makes sense uh
[14:52] host name so it makes sense uh
[14:52] host name so it makes sense uh for me to make sure that my ies site is
[14:55] for me to make sure that my ies site is
[14:55] for me to make sure that my ies site is going to be responsive
[14:56] going to be responsive
[14:56] going to be responsive when i'm addressing this way okay so
[14:59] when i'm addressing this way okay so
[14:59] when i'm addressing this way okay so let's save this
[15:00] let's save this
[15:00] let's save this and now let's open the website right
[15:01] and now let's open the website right
[15:02] and now let's open the website right click on it and say add application
[15:04] click on it and say add application
[15:04] click on it and say add application give it an alias of zero and specify
[15:07] give it an alias of zero and specify
[15:07] give it an alias of zero and specify physical path
[15:08] physical path
[15:08] physical path to the same folder but inside that
[15:10] to the same folder but inside that
[15:10] to the same folder but inside that folder there is another folder called
[15:12] folder there is another folder called
[15:12] folder there is another folder called chairsoft web app so let's just make
[15:14] chairsoft web app so let's just make
[15:14] chairsoft web app so let's just make sure that we
[15:15] sure that we
[15:15] sure that we select airsoft web app at this point
[15:17] select airsoft web app at this point
[15:17] select airsoft web app at this point good
[15:19] good
[15:19] good as soon as you add this application a
[15:21] as soon as you add this application a
[15:21] as soon as you add this application a new application pool will be created in
[15:23] new application pool will be created in
[15:23] new application pool will be created in iis
[15:24] iis
[15:24] iis if it doesn't get created you can go and
[15:26] if it doesn't get created you can go and
[15:26] if it doesn't get created you can go and manually add it
[15:27] manually add it
[15:27] manually add it by hand so all you can do is you can say
[15:29] by hand so all you can do is you can say
[15:29] by hand so all you can do is you can say add application pool
[15:31] add application pool
[15:31] add application pool give it a name so let's say test pool
[15:33] give it a name so let's say test pool
[15:33] give it a name so let's say test pool make sure that it's a clr
[15:35] make sure that it's a clr
[15:35] make sure that it's a clr integrated start immediately here's my
[15:37] integrated start immediately here's my
[15:38] integrated start immediately here's my test app pool
[15:39] test app pool
[15:39] test app pool and if i wanted to add an application
[15:40] and if i wanted to add an application
[15:40] and if i wanted to add an application pool so for example i'm going to add
[15:42] pool so for example i'm going to add
[15:42] pool so for example i'm going to add an application when i'm creating it here
[15:46] an application when i'm creating it here
[15:46] an application when i'm creating it here i can select the application that i uh i
[15:48] i can select the application that i uh i
[15:48] i can select the application that i uh i can use any pool that i have previously
[15:50] can use any pool that i have previously
[15:50] can use any pool that i have previously selected
[15:51] selected
[15:51] selected so you can go ahead and create the pool
[15:53] so you can go ahead and create the pool
[15:53] so you can go ahead and create the pool first and then
[15:54] first and then
[15:54] first and then add the application or you can just
[15:56] add the application or you can just
[15:56] add the application or you can just simply add the application and the pool
[15:57] simply add the application and the pool
[15:57] simply add the application and the pool will be created
[15:58] will be created
[15:58] will be created now if the pool doesn't get created in
[16:00] now if the pool doesn't get created in
[16:00] now if the pool doesn't get created in the right way then just make sure that
[16:01] the right way then just make sure that
[16:01] the right way then just make sure that you
[16:02] you
[16:02] you override it by hand okay so now we've
[16:05] override it by hand okay so now we've
[16:05] override it by hand okay so now we've got the application pool and we've got
[16:08] got the application pool and we've got
[16:08] got the application pool and we've got the website configured and if you try
[16:10] the website configured and if you try
[16:10] the website configured and if you try navigating to this port 7010
[16:12] navigating to this port 7010
[16:12] navigating to this port 7010 then you're going to get an error we
[16:14] then you're going to get an error we
[16:14] then you're going to get an error we have not specified a connection string
[16:16] have not specified a connection string
[16:16] have not specified a connection string to our redis database
[16:18] to our redis database
[16:18] to our redis database we have not specified a string to our
[16:21] we have not specified a string to our
[16:21] we have not specified a string to our data database server
[16:22] data database server
[16:22] data database server and this is what we're going to do next
[16:24] and this is what we're going to do next
[16:24] and this is what we're going to do next so the website at this point is not
[16:26] so the website at this point is not
[16:26] so the website at this point is not working at all
[16:28] working at all
[16:28] working at all all right if we want to follow the
[16:30] all right if we want to follow the
[16:30] all right if we want to follow the instructions
[16:31] instructions
[16:31] instructions uh we can take a look how we can
[16:34] uh we can take a look how we can
[16:34] uh we can take a look how we can install redis and how we can install the
[16:37] install redis and how we can install the
[16:37] install redis and how we can install the database
[16:38] database
[16:38] database but in my particular case what i'm going
[16:40] but in my particular case what i'm going
[16:40] but in my particular case what i'm going to do is i'm going to just simply start
[16:42] to do is i'm going to just simply start
[16:42] to do is i'm going to just simply start my iis
[16:43] my iis
[16:43] my iis so my uh not my is my sql so
[16:46] so my uh not my is my sql so
[16:46] so my uh not my is my sql so i have um
[16:50] i have um
[16:50] i have um i have sql installed already i'm not
[16:52] i have sql installed already i'm not
[16:52] i have sql installed already i'm not going to go through the installation
[16:54] going to go through the installation
[16:54] going to go through the installation uh just follow uh standard
[16:57] uh just follow uh standard
[16:57] uh just follow uh standard sql express installation tutorials
[17:00] sql express installation tutorials
[17:00] sql express installation tutorials online
[17:00] online
[17:00] online and you will be able to figure out how
[17:03] and you will be able to figure out how
[17:03] and you will be able to figure out how to do that
[17:04] to do that
[17:04] to do that in my case the service is not started so
[17:07] in my case the service is not started so
[17:07] in my case the service is not started so i'm going to go and start
[17:08] i'm going to go and start
[17:08] i'm going to go and start you don't need to do that if you if you
[17:11] you don't need to do that if you if you
[17:11] you don't need to do that if you if you never shut it down so if you just simply
[17:13] never shut it down so if you just simply
[17:13] never shut it down so if you just simply installed it
[17:14] installed it
[17:14] installed it then you don't need to do anything i'm
[17:15] then you don't need to do anything i'm
[17:15] then you don't need to do anything i'm also going to start the agent as well
[17:17] also going to start the agent as well
[17:17] also going to start the agent as well so just come here and click start
[17:25] okay perfect so now everything is up and
[17:25] okay perfect so now everything is up and running
[17:26] running
[17:26] running and the next thing that we need to do is
[17:28] and the next thing that we need to do is
[17:28] and the next thing that we need to do is we need to log on to our sql server
[17:31] we need to log on to our sql server
[17:31] we need to log on to our sql server make sure that we note the connection
[17:33] make sure that we note the connection
[17:33] make sure that we note the connection string and then we're going to have to
[17:35] string and then we're going to have to
[17:35] string and then we're going to have to go
[17:35] go
[17:35] go and adjust this connection string all
[17:38] and adjust this connection string all
[17:38] and adjust this connection string all right
[17:39] right
[17:39] right for that i'm going to use sql studio but
[17:42] for that i'm going to use sql studio but
[17:42] for that i'm going to use sql studio but before you do a sql studio let me point
[17:44] before you do a sql studio let me point
[17:44] before you do a sql studio let me point out to couple of uh
[17:47] out to couple of uh
[17:47] out to couple of uh common mistakes or common
[17:50] common mistakes or common
[17:50] common mistakes or common issues that people might be having so
[17:52] issues that people might be having so
[17:52] issues that people might be having so let's go into
[17:54] let's go into
[17:54] let's go into sql server i believe it's called
[17:58] sql server i believe it's called
[17:58] sql server i believe it's called uh i think that's the installation
[18:01] uh i think that's the installation
[18:01] uh i think that's the installation center or
[18:02] center or
[18:02] center or import export data i'm sorry
[18:05] import export data i'm sorry
[18:05] import export data i'm sorry uh sql server
[18:09] uh sql server
[18:09] uh sql server uh where's this management studio
[18:11] uh where's this management studio
[18:11] uh where's this management studio profiler
[18:13] profiler
[18:13] profiler error
[18:20] uh you know what let's just skip it for
[18:20] uh you know what let's just skip it for now let's go let's go straight into
[18:23] now let's go let's go straight into
[18:23] now let's go let's go straight into studio studio
[18:28] studio studio
[18:28] studio studio inside sql studio we'll use this product
[18:31] inside sql studio we'll use this product
[18:31] inside sql studio we'll use this product to restore the database and
[18:33] to restore the database and
[18:33] to restore the database and feed the feed the drive feed the file
[18:36] feed the feed the drive feed the file
[18:36] feed the feed the drive feed the file that's located here in db folder
[18:38] that's located here in db folder
[18:38] that's located here in db folder so this is what we're going to be
[18:39] so this is what we're going to be
[18:40] so this is what we're going to be restoring right now
[18:42] restoring right now
[18:42] restoring right now let me connect to my instance i'm
[18:43] let me connect to my instance i'm
[18:43] let me connect to my instance i'm connecting as the administrator
[18:46] connecting as the administrator
[18:46] connecting as the administrator with the help of and uh with the help of
[18:48] with the help of and uh with the help of
[18:48] with the help of and uh with the help of nt authentication
[18:49] nt authentication
[18:49] nt authentication but you need to make sure off on your
[18:51] but you need to make sure off on your
[18:51] but you need to make sure off on your sql express and this is probably the
[18:53] sql express and this is probably the
[18:53] sql express and this is probably the easiest
[18:54] easiest
[18:54] easiest configuration is to go right click on
[18:56] configuration is to go right click on
[18:56] configuration is to go right click on the name of your server
[18:57] the name of your server
[18:57] the name of your server click properties and in security make
[19:00] click properties and in security make
[19:00] click properties and in security make sure that you allow
[19:02] sure that you allow
[19:02] sure that you allow sql server authentication mode now you
[19:05] sql server authentication mode now you
[19:05] sql server authentication mode now you can
[19:05] can
[19:05] can use it with windows authentication mode
[19:07] use it with windows authentication mode
[19:07] use it with windows authentication mode in my particular case i'm using sql
[19:10] in my particular case i'm using sql
[19:10] in my particular case i'm using sql server authentication mode rather than
[19:12] server authentication mode rather than
[19:12] server authentication mode rather than windows so i can specify the username
[19:14] windows so i can specify the username
[19:14] windows so i can specify the username and password
[19:15] and password
[19:15] and password directly in my connection string when
[19:17] directly in my connection string when
[19:17] directly in my connection string when i'm using it for
[19:19] i'm using it for
[19:19] i'm using it for when i'm using it with with my product
[19:23] when i'm using it with with my product
[19:23] when i'm using it with with my product okay let's go in the database and i have
[19:26] okay let's go in the database and i have
[19:26] okay let's go in the database and i have i believe one database here already
[19:27] i believe one database here already
[19:27] i believe one database here already installed so let's just simply right
[19:29] installed so let's just simply right
[19:29] installed so let's just simply right click
[19:30] click
[19:30] click on the databases and say restore
[19:32] on the databases and say restore
[19:32] on the databases and say restore database so here's the
[19:34] database so here's the
[19:34] database so here's the option restore database and we're going
[19:36] option restore database and we're going
[19:36] option restore database and we're going to specify device
[19:38] to specify device
[19:38] to specify device from which we're restoring and device
[19:39] from which we're restoring and device
[19:39] from which we're restoring and device happens to be just a physical location
[19:42] happens to be just a physical location
[19:42] happens to be just a physical location so we're going to go back on our c drive
[19:44] so we're going to go back on our c drive
[19:44] so we're going to go back on our c drive find creation demo
[19:46] find creation demo
[19:46] find creation demo find db folder select it and here's my
[19:50] find db folder select it and here's my
[19:50] find db folder select it and here's my backup file
[19:52] backup file
[19:52] backup file and let's click ok now the studio
[19:55] and let's click ok now the studio
[19:55] and let's click ok now the studio database that's a default name that's
[19:57] database that's a default name that's
[19:57] database that's a default name that's going to be
[19:58] going to be
[19:58] going to be given by the creators of this backup you
[20:01] given by the creators of this backup you
[20:01] given by the creators of this backup you can rename it at any
[20:03] can rename it at any
[20:03] can rename it at any you can rename it at this point and why
[20:05] you can rename it at this point and why
[20:05] you can rename it at this point and why don't we just take a look what we call
[20:06] don't we just take a look what we call
[20:06] don't we just take a look what we call their website in is
[20:09] their website in is
[20:09] their website in is we called it creatio studio
[20:13] we called it creatio studio
[20:13] we called it creatio studio and let's go ahead and call this thing
[20:14] and let's go ahead and call this thing
[20:14] and let's go ahead and call this thing as well creation
[20:17] as well creation
[20:17] as well creation studio now it's going to perform a full
[20:19] studio now it's going to perform a full
[20:19] studio now it's going to perform a full backup it's telling you the version
[20:21] backup it's telling you the version
[20:21] backup it's telling you the version of the backup and just simply click ok
[20:29] the backup doesn't take too long and in
[20:29] the backup doesn't take too long and in later
[20:29] later
[20:29] later uh parts of the tutorial i'll show you
[20:31] uh parts of the tutorial i'll show you
[20:31] uh parts of the tutorial i'll show you how to restore it with the help of
[20:32] how to restore it with the help of
[20:32] how to restore it with the help of powershell so you don't have to do it by
[20:34] powershell so you don't have to do it by
[20:34] powershell so you don't have to do it by hand
[20:35] hand
[20:36] hand okay so now that we've restored the
[20:37] okay so now that we've restored the
[20:37] okay so now that we've restored the database we also need to make sure that
[20:39] database we also need to make sure that
[20:39] database we also need to make sure that we have a user who can connect to this
[20:41] we have a user who can connect to this
[20:41] we have a user who can connect to this database
[20:42] database
[20:42] database now to create a user you can go into
[20:44] now to create a user you can go into
[20:44] now to create a user you can go into security and to
[20:46] security and to
[20:46] security and to logins and just simply right click on
[20:48] logins and just simply right click on
[20:48] logins and just simply right click on the login create new login
[20:50] the login create new login
[20:50] the login create new login come up with the name make sure it's a
[20:51] come up with the name make sure it's a
[20:51] come up with the name make sure it's a sql authentication
[20:53] sql authentication
[20:53] sql authentication provide the name username and password
[20:55] provide the name username and password
[20:55] provide the name username and password make sure that you uncheck enforce
[20:56] make sure that you uncheck enforce
[20:56] make sure that you uncheck enforce policy security so you can provide some
[20:58] policy security so you can provide some
[20:58] policy security so you can provide some simple passwords such as one one one
[21:01] simple passwords such as one one one
[21:01] simple passwords such as one one one since it's just a development machine
[21:02] since it's just a development machine
[21:02] since it's just a development machine we don't want any any issues with the
[21:05] we don't want any any issues with the
[21:05] we don't want any any issues with the security here
[21:07] security here
[21:07] security here so i've done that already and i've
[21:08] so i've done that already and i've
[21:08] so i've done that already and i've created myself two usernames one is
[21:10] created myself two usernames one is
[21:10] created myself two usernames one is called creation one is called supervisor
[21:12] called creation one is called supervisor
[21:12] called creation one is called supervisor for no good reason it just the name that
[21:15] for no good reason it just the name that
[21:15] for no good reason it just the name that i've decided to give
[21:15] i've decided to give
[21:16] i've decided to give it let's now go back into our database
[21:19] it let's now go back into our database
[21:19] it let's now go back into our database the one that we just restored and what
[21:21] the one that we just restored and what
[21:21] the one that we just restored and what we can do is we can either right click
[21:23] we can do is we can either right click
[21:23] we can do is we can either right click on the database here go into properties
[21:25] on the database here go into properties
[21:25] on the database here go into properties and we can specify permissions okay and
[21:28] and we can specify permissions okay and
[21:28] and we can specify permissions okay and create user mappings this way
[21:30] create user mappings this way
[21:30] create user mappings this way but what i find the easiest is just to
[21:32] but what i find the easiest is just to
[21:32] but what i find the easiest is just to simply go to a login right click on the
[21:34] simply go to a login right click on the
[21:34] simply go to a login right click on the login go to properties
[21:35] login go to properties
[21:35] login go to properties and from the properties you go to user
[21:38] and from the properties you go to user
[21:38] and from the properties you go to user mappings
[21:39] mappings
[21:39] mappings okay choose the user mapping that you
[21:42] okay choose the user mapping that you
[21:42] okay choose the user mapping that you would like to use in this case you can
[21:44] would like to use in this case you can
[21:44] would like to use in this case you can say creatio studio
[21:45] say creatio studio
[21:45] say creatio studio and make sure that you give it a role of
[21:47] and make sure that you give it a role of
[21:47] and make sure that you give it a role of db owner
[21:52] now we can do the same thing for say
[21:52] now we can do the same thing for say another user if you want to have more
[21:54] another user if you want to have more
[21:54] another user if you want to have more than one user connecting to this
[21:55] than one user connecting to this
[21:55] than one user connecting to this database
[21:56] database
[21:56] database so all we have to do is use our mapping
[21:59] so all we have to do is use our mapping
[21:59] so all we have to do is use our mapping and where's my creation studio and let's
[22:01] and where's my creation studio and let's
[22:01] and where's my creation studio and let's just give it a db owner
[22:04] just give it a db owner
[22:04] just give it a db owner perfect so now we have a user we can
[22:07] perfect so now we have a user we can
[22:07] perfect so now we have a user we can try logging on so to make sure that i
[22:10] try logging on so to make sure that i
[22:10] try logging on so to make sure that i can
[22:10] can
[22:10] can actually connect what i'm going to do is
[22:12] actually connect what i'm going to do is
[22:12] actually connect what i'm going to do is i'm going to disconnect now and i'm
[22:13] i'm going to disconnect now and i'm
[22:13] i'm going to disconnect now and i'm going to try to reconnect
[22:15] going to try to reconnect
[22:15] going to try to reconnect and instead of using windows
[22:16] and instead of using windows
[22:16] and instead of using windows authentication i'm going to try to use
[22:18] authentication i'm going to try to use
[22:18] authentication i'm going to try to use sql authentication
[22:20] sql authentication
[22:20] sql authentication and i think the password is
[22:27] supervisor let me connect
[22:28] supervisor let me connect and i can see that i can connect and i
[22:29] and i can see that i can connect and i
[22:29] and i can see that i can connect and i have access to creation studio
[22:31] have access to creation studio
[22:31] have access to creation studio i can perform queries
[22:40] uh so let's make sure we use creation
[22:40] uh so let's make sure we use creation studio and let's
[22:43] studio and let's
[22:43] studio and let's select i don't know id from contact
[22:47] select i don't know id from contact
[22:47] select i don't know id from contact and if i execute the query you could
[22:49] and if i execute the query you could
[22:49] and if i execute the query you could tell that i'm getting some records back
[22:51] tell that i'm getting some records back
[22:51] tell that i'm getting some records back perfect so i've got my database working
[22:53] perfect so i've got my database working
[22:53] perfect so i've got my database working it's now time for me to
[22:55] it's now time for me to
[22:55] it's now time for me to configure my connection strings now
[22:58] configure my connection strings now
[22:58] configure my connection strings now what i'm going to do is i'm going to
[23:00] what i'm going to do is i'm going to
[23:00] what i'm going to do is i'm going to actually copy this
[23:02] actually copy this
[23:02] actually copy this copy this uh database name for
[23:05] copy this uh database name for
[23:05] copy this uh database name for later use but now let's go ahead and
[23:08] later use but now let's go ahead and
[23:08] later use but now let's go ahead and configure it so
[23:11] configure it so
[23:11] configure it so in our
[23:17] i think this is us right no this is us
[23:17] i think this is us right no this is us on this disk uh directory there is a
[23:20] on this disk uh directory there is a
[23:20] on this disk uh directory there is a file called connection string
[23:22] file called connection string
[23:22] file called connection string let's find it here's a connection string
[23:24] let's find it here's a connection string
[23:24] let's find it here's a connection string and i'll open it with my favorite text
[23:26] and i'll open it with my favorite text
[23:26] and i'll open it with my favorite text editor
[23:27] editor
[23:27] editor so here's my connection string and i
[23:28] so here's my connection string and i
[23:28] so here's my connection string and i have an example of a connection string
[23:30] have an example of a connection string
[23:30] have an example of a connection string that i was using in the past this is
[23:31] that i was using in the past this is
[23:31] that i was using in the past this is what it's going to look like
[23:33] what it's going to look like
[23:33] what it's going to look like when you open it on your screen and
[23:35] when you open it on your screen and
[23:35] when you open it on your screen and we're going to have to modify a couple
[23:36] we're going to have to modify a couple
[23:36] we're going to have to modify a couple of lines here
[23:37] of lines here
[23:37] of lines here the first line that you want to modify
[23:39] the first line that you want to modify
[23:39] the first line that you want to modify is this this is the line that's
[23:41] is this this is the line that's
[23:41] is this this is the line that's responsible for specifying where your
[23:43] responsible for specifying where your
[23:43] responsible for specifying where your redis lives
[23:45] redis lives
[23:45] redis lives now in my case my redis lives on my
[23:47] now in my case my redis lives on my
[23:47] now in my case my redis lives on my local host so i can just simply say
[23:50] local host so i can just simply say
[23:50] local host so i can just simply say localhost or local host
[23:54] localhost or local host
[23:54] localhost or local host i have to assign a database by default
[23:56] i have to assign a database by default
[23:56] i have to assign a database by default redis when installed in docker or as a
[23:59] redis when installed in docker or as a
[23:59] redis when installed in docker or as a windows service has 16 databases with
[24:01] windows service has 16 databases with
[24:01] windows service has 16 databases with the
[24:01] the
[24:02] the xero based index so 0 is the first
[24:05] xero based index so 0 is the first
[24:05] xero based index so 0 is the first database and 15 is the last one
[24:07] database and 15 is the last one
[24:07] database and 15 is the last one so we're going to give it let's say
[24:08] so we're going to give it let's say
[24:08] so we're going to give it let's say database 15 as i i'm pretty sure i'm not
[24:11] database 15 as i i'm pretty sure i'm not
[24:11] database 15 as i i'm pretty sure i'm not using it for anything
[24:12] using it for anything
[24:12] using it for anything at the moment on my machine 6379 is a
[24:16] at the moment on my machine 6379 is a
[24:16] at the moment on my machine 6379 is a default port for redis so if you haven't
[24:18] default port for redis so if you haven't
[24:18] default port for redis so if you haven't configured anything
[24:19] configured anything
[24:19] configured anything differently then 6379 is going to be the
[24:22] differently then 6379 is going to be the
[24:22] differently then 6379 is going to be the port that
[24:23] port that
[24:23] port that radius will listen on the next thing for
[24:26] radius will listen on the next thing for
[24:26] radius will listen on the next thing for us to configure
[24:27] us to configure
[24:27] us to configure is this line and this line is our
[24:30] is this line and this line is our
[24:30] is this line and this line is our database connection let me just copy
[24:32] database connection let me just copy
[24:32] database connection let me just copy this database connection string
[24:34] this database connection string
[24:34] this database connection string you can build your own but i'm since
[24:35] you can build your own but i'm since
[24:35] you can build your own but i'm since i've already pre-built it
[24:37] i've already pre-built it
[24:37] i've already pre-built it i'm just simply going to copy it here
[24:40] i'm just simply going to copy it here
[24:40] i'm just simply going to copy it here and we're going to tweak it a little bit
[24:43] and we're going to tweak it a little bit
[24:43] and we're going to tweak it a little bit so in this case i'm specifying a data
[24:45] so in this case i'm specifying a data
[24:45] so in this case i'm specifying a data source for
[24:46] source for
[24:46] source for my instance of sql and i can easily get
[24:49] my instance of sql and i can easily get
[24:49] my instance of sql and i can easily get it if i look
[24:49] it if i look
[24:49] it if i look at my sql management studio i
[24:53] at my sql management studio i
[24:53] at my sql management studio i you can tell what this is it's going to
[24:55] you can tell what this is it's going to
[24:55] you can tell what this is it's going to say
[24:56] say
[24:56] say your connection string here not
[24:57] your connection string here not
[24:57] your connection string here not connection string that the instance of
[24:59] connection string that the instance of
[24:59] connection string that the instance of the server
[25:00] the server
[25:00] the server you can also simply disconnect from it
[25:02] you can also simply disconnect from it
[25:02] you can also simply disconnect from it and try to reconnect
[25:04] and try to reconnect
[25:04] and try to reconnect and here is your connection string
[25:06] and here is your connection string
[25:06] and here is your connection string another connection string but the
[25:08] another connection string but the
[25:08] another connection string but the server name the initial catalog refers
[25:10] server name the initial catalog refers
[25:10] server name the initial catalog refers to the database name
[25:11] to the database name
[25:12] to the database name so if we're going to go back here as a
[25:16] so if we're going to go back here as a
[25:16] so if we're going to go back here as a um let me just log in
[25:20] um let me just log in
[25:20] um let me just log in and the database that we would like to
[25:21] and the database that we would like to
[25:22] and the database that we would like to target is this so
[25:23] target is this so
[25:23] target is this so select this database press f2 and just
[25:26] select this database press f2 and just
[25:26] select this database press f2 and just simply
[25:27] simply
[25:27] simply copy the name of the database so that's
[25:30] copy the name of the database so that's
[25:30] copy the name of the database so that's going to be
[25:31] going to be
[25:31] going to be my database name now the user id in
[25:34] my database name now the user id in
[25:34] my database name now the user id in mind the space between the user and id
[25:36] mind the space between the user and id
[25:36] mind the space between the user and id this is the right spelling
[25:38] this is the right spelling
[25:38] this is the right spelling is going to say creation this is the
[25:40] is going to say creation this is the
[25:40] is going to say creation this is the user who's going to be accessing
[25:42] user who's going to be accessing
[25:42] user who's going to be accessing our database or essentially this is
[25:44] our database or essentially this is
[25:44] our database or essentially this is going to be the user that the
[25:46] going to be the user that the
[25:46] going to be the user that the application pool is using to access the
[25:48] application pool is using to access the
[25:48] application pool is using to access the database
[25:49] database
[25:49] database we're then specifying the password and
[25:51] we're then specifying the password and
[25:51] we're then specifying the password and this is the reason that i wanted to use
[25:54] this is the reason that i wanted to use
[25:54] this is the reason that i wanted to use sql authentication so i can specify it
[25:57] sql authentication so i can specify it
[25:57] sql authentication so i can specify it very vividly
[25:58] very vividly
[25:58] very vividly right here in my connection string and
[26:01] right here in my connection string and
[26:01] right here in my connection string and then couple of other properties how to
[26:02] then couple of other properties how to
[26:02] then couple of other properties how to manage the connection
[26:03] manage the connection
[26:03] manage the connection this is all we have to do in order for
[26:06] this is all we have to do in order for
[26:06] this is all we have to do in order for us to start with the application
[26:08] us to start with the application
[26:08] us to start with the application so let's make sure we save this and we
[26:10] so let's make sure we save this and we
[26:10] so let's make sure we save this and we can now
[26:11] can now
[26:11] can now roll down our studio the next thing that
[26:14] roll down our studio the next thing that
[26:14] roll down our studio the next thing that i want to do is i want to simply check
[26:16] i want to do is i want to simply check
[26:16] i want to do is i want to simply check if my application is running now we can
[26:19] if my application is running now we can
[26:19] if my application is running now we can specify additional properties and
[26:20] specify additional properties and
[26:20] specify additional properties and additional settings and configure them
[26:22] additional settings and configure them
[26:22] additional settings and configure them but that's something that we're going to
[26:23] but that's something that we're going to
[26:24] but that's something that we're going to do with the help of a batch file that
[26:26] do with the help of a batch file that
[26:26] do with the help of a batch file that i've prepared for us that will do all
[26:27] i've prepared for us that will do all
[26:28] i've prepared for us that will do all this work for us automatically
[26:30] this work for us automatically
[26:30] this work for us automatically let's make sure that we can navigate to
[26:31] let's make sure that we can navigate to
[26:32] let's make sure that we can navigate to 7010 and that the application actually
[26:34] 7010 and that the application actually
[26:34] 7010 and that the application actually starts
[26:35] starts
[26:35] starts in some cases this application may not
[26:38] in some cases this application may not
[26:38] in some cases this application may not start and will give you some errors
[26:40] start and will give you some errors
[26:40] start and will give you some errors so in this case system argument
[26:42] so in this case system argument
[26:42] so in this case system argument exception parameter host cannot be
[26:44] exception parameter host cannot be
[26:44] exception parameter host cannot be empty string now it's too bad it's not
[26:46] empty string now it's too bad it's not
[26:46] empty string now it's too bad it's not telling us where but
[26:48] telling us where but
[26:48] telling us where but we simply need to go and configure um
[26:52] we simply need to go and configure um
[26:52] we simply need to go and configure um go and find where we did not configure
[26:55] go and find where we did not configure
[26:55] go and find where we did not configure this so maybe it's in our
[26:57] this so maybe it's in our
[26:57] this so maybe it's in our connection string so let's just simply
[26:59] connection string so let's just simply
[26:59] connection string so let's just simply find
[27:00] find
[27:00] find the connection string and host has to be
[27:03] the connection string and host has to be
[27:03] the connection string and host has to be i believe
[27:04] i believe
[27:04] i believe this way so i i believe i missed the
[27:07] this way so i i believe i missed the
[27:07] this way so i i believe i missed the word host this is the proper spelling
[27:09] word host this is the proper spelling
[27:09] word host this is the proper spelling and i forgot it so if you make a mistake
[27:11] and i forgot it so if you make a mistake
[27:12] and i forgot it so if you make a mistake you will get an error here
[27:13] you will get an error here
[27:13] you will get an error here this way this kind of error message and
[27:16] this way this kind of error message and
[27:16] this way this kind of error message and just make sure that you
[27:17] just make sure that you
[27:17] just make sure that you uh you can debug it you will also get
[27:19] uh you can debug it you will also get
[27:19] uh you can debug it you will also get some ideas or some hints
[27:21] some ideas or some hints
[27:21] some ideas or some hints into what's not working in this
[27:23] into what's not working in this
[27:23] into what's not working in this particular pic in this particular case
[27:25] particular pic in this particular case
[27:25] particular pic in this particular case you could clearly see that
[27:26] you could clearly see that
[27:26] you could clearly see that there's a lot of mention of redis so you
[27:29] there's a lot of mention of redis so you
[27:29] there's a lot of mention of redis so you know that something is going on with
[27:30] know that something is going on with
[27:30] know that something is going on with redis
[27:31] redis
[27:31] redis let's just try to f5 on this page and
[27:33] let's just try to f5 on this page and
[27:33] let's just try to f5 on this page and reload it
[27:34] reload it
[27:34] reload it if everything goes correctly i should
[27:35] if everything goes correctly i should
[27:35] if everything goes correctly i should see a login page which is what i expect
[27:37] see a login page which is what i expect
[27:37] see a login page which is what i expect at this point
[27:39] at this point
[27:39] at this point also mind you that you get some
[27:40] also mind you that you get some
[27:40] also mind you that you get some redirects here okay and at this point we
[27:42] redirects here okay and at this point we
[27:42] redirects here okay and at this point we can try to log in with the super
[27:45] can try to log in with the super
[27:45] can try to log in with the super supervisor supervisor
[27:48] supervisor supervisor
[27:48] supervisor supervisor now another reason that i've created
[27:50] now another reason that i've created
[27:50] now another reason that i've created this creation supervisor username and
[27:51] this creation supervisor username and
[27:52] this creation supervisor username and password here is that
[27:53] password here is that
[27:53] password here is that what the database credentials are in
[27:56] what the database credentials are in
[27:56] what the database credentials are in here for this database
[27:58] here for this database
[27:58] here for this database they have nothing to do with what your
[28:01] they have nothing to do with what your
[28:01] they have nothing to do with what your username and password will be here
[28:03] username and password will be here
[28:03] username and password will be here and the reason they have nothing to do
[28:04] and the reason they have nothing to do
[28:04] and the reason they have nothing to do here is because
[28:06] here is because
[28:06] here is because this is how you're accessing the
[28:07] this is how you're accessing the
[28:08] this is how you're accessing the database
[28:09] database
[28:09] database and supervisor supervisor is how you're
[28:11] and supervisor supervisor is how you're
[28:11] and supervisor supervisor is how you're actually accessing the application
[28:14] actually accessing the application
[28:14] actually accessing the application the first time we start the application
[28:15] the first time we start the application
[28:15] the first time we start the application it might take us a little while
[28:17] it might take us a little while
[28:17] it might take us a little while to load the application but then
[28:19] to load the application but then
[28:19] to load the application but then essentially everything
[28:20] essentially everything
[28:20] essentially everything works just fine now once your
[28:23] works just fine now once your
[28:23] works just fine now once your application is loaded for the first time
[28:24] application is loaded for the first time
[28:24] application is loaded for the first time you can try
[28:25] you can try
[28:25] you can try navigating from place to place you can
[28:27] navigating from place to place you can
[28:27] navigating from place to place you can go to different sections just to make
[28:29] go to different sections just to make
[28:29] go to different sections just to make sure
[28:29] sure
[28:29] sure everything works fine the best test and
[28:32] everything works fine the best test and
[28:32] everything works fine the best test and the best
[28:33] the best
[28:33] the best the best advice that i can give you is
[28:34] the best advice that i can give you is
[28:34] the best advice that i can give you is to just go into a cog wheel here
[28:36] to just go into a cog wheel here
[28:36] to just go into a cog wheel here scroll all the way down go to your
[28:38] scroll all the way down go to your
[28:38] scroll all the way down go to your advanced settings another by the way
[28:40] advanced settings another by the way
[28:40] advanced settings another by the way shortcut in the advanced settings if you
[28:42] shortcut in the advanced settings if you
[28:42] shortcut in the advanced settings if you open the new tab
[28:45] open the new tab
[28:45] open the new tab and if you go to slash zero slash dev it
[28:47] and if you go to slash zero slash dev it
[28:47] and if you go to slash zero slash dev it will also take you in the back end
[28:50] will also take you in the back end
[28:50] will also take you in the back end now when you're here in the back end the
[28:51] now when you're here in the back end the
[28:51] now when you're here in the back end the thing that you want to check is to make
[28:53] thing that you want to check is to make
[28:53] thing that you want to check is to make sure that everything compiles
[28:55] sure that everything compiles
[28:55] sure that everything compiles you usually do it only for the first
[28:56] you usually do it only for the first
[28:56] you usually do it only for the first time on the machine that you're
[28:57] time on the machine that you're
[28:57] time on the machine that you're installing the application for the first
[28:59] installing the application for the first
[28:59] installing the application for the first time so if it's your server
[29:01] time so if it's your server
[29:01] time so if it's your server and it's the first time you're
[29:02] and it's the first time you're
[29:02] and it's the first time you're installing application for the first
[29:03] installing application for the first
[29:03] installing application for the first time you want to make sure that the
[29:04] time you want to make sure that the
[29:04] time you want to make sure that the dependencies are addressed
[29:06] dependencies are addressed
[29:06] dependencies are addressed to make sure that everything is
[29:08] to make sure that everything is
[29:08] to make sure that everything is installed just simply click on compile
[29:10] installed just simply click on compile
[29:10] installed just simply click on compile if you're missing some components the
[29:12] if you're missing some components the
[29:12] if you're missing some components the compilation will let you know
[29:13] compilation will let you know
[29:13] compilation will let you know immediately
[29:14] immediately
[29:14] immediately or it will let you know immediately
[29:16] or it will let you know immediately
[29:16] or it will let you know immediately after it fails to compile
[29:18] after it fails to compile
[29:18] after it fails to compile so it one way or the other if your
[29:20] so it one way or the other if your
[29:20] so it one way or the other if your compilation is successful
[29:21] compilation is successful
[29:21] compilation is successful then you know everything is installed
[29:23] then you know everything is installed
[29:23] then you know everything is installed correctly now this is not the first time
[29:25] correctly now this is not the first time
[29:25] correctly now this is not the first time that i'm installing a
[29:27] that i'm installing a
[29:27] that i'm installing a instance of creation on this machine so
[29:29] instance of creation on this machine so
[29:29] instance of creation on this machine so i'm pretty confident that things will go
[29:32] i'm pretty confident that things will go
[29:32] i'm pretty confident that things will go as planned now after this
[29:35] as planned now after this
[29:35] as planned now after this compilation is completed you can see you
[29:37] compilation is completed you can see you
[29:37] compilation is completed you can see you can you can then
[29:39] can you can then
[29:39] can you can then go ahead and convert it to development
[29:40] go ahead and convert it to development
[29:40] go ahead and convert it to development and file system mode or do whatever it
[29:42] and file system mode or do whatever it
[29:42] and file system mode or do whatever it is that you want to do
[29:43] is that you want to do
[29:43] is that you want to do and in my case you could tell that the
[29:45] and in my case you could tell that the
[29:45] and in my case you could tell that the operation was successful so i now know
[29:47] operation was successful so i now know
[29:47] operation was successful so i now know that everything that i did is correctly
[29:49] that everything that i did is correctly
[29:49] that everything that i did is correctly installed
[29:51] installed
[29:51] installed the next couple of things that we want
[29:53] the next couple of things that we want
[29:53] the next couple of things that we want to do is we want to probably configure
[29:55] to do is we want to probably configure
[29:55] to do is we want to probably configure it to operate
[29:56] it to operate
[29:56] it to operate with the to work with the exchange
[29:59] with the to work with the exchange
[29:59] with the to work with the exchange listener
[30:00] listener
[30:00] listener to maybe install uh identity service and
[30:03] to maybe install uh identity service and
[30:03] to maybe install uh identity service and things of that nature
[30:04] things of that nature
[30:04] things of that nature now previous episodes demonstrated how
[30:07] now previous episodes demonstrated how
[30:07] now previous episodes demonstrated how to configure
[30:08] to configure
[30:08] to configure exchange listeners so i'm not going to
[30:09] exchange listeners so i'm not going to
[30:09] exchange listeners so i'm not going to spend time on that but what i will spend
[30:11] spend time on that but what i will spend
[30:11] spend time on that but what i will spend time on a little bit right now
[30:13] time on a little bit right now
[30:13] time on a little bit right now is to show you how and walk you through
[30:15] is to show you how and walk you through
[30:15] is to show you how and walk you through a powershell script that will help you
[30:17] a powershell script that will help you
[30:17] a powershell script that will help you configure the application in a similar
[30:19] configure the application in a similar
[30:19] configure the application in a similar fashion
[30:20] fashion
[30:20] fashion so let me close this down let me close
[30:24] so let me close this down let me close
[30:24] so let me close this down let me close this
[30:24] this
[30:24] this on this thing down okay let me close all
[30:28] on this thing down okay let me close all
[30:28] on this thing down okay let me close all this stuff down
[30:29] this stuff down
[30:29] this stuff down and what i'm going to do is i'm going to
[30:30] and what i'm going to do is i'm going to
[30:30] and what i'm going to do is i'm going to stop uh all these
[30:33] stop uh all these
[30:33] stop uh all these applications i don't want it to consume
[30:34] applications i don't want it to consume
[30:34] applications i don't want it to consume any any ram right now
[30:37] any any ram right now
[30:37] any any ram right now so i'm going to stop them all
[30:40] so i'm going to stop them all
[30:40] so i'm going to stop them all my test pool i can stop and everything
[30:44] my test pool i can stop and everything
[30:44] my test pool i can stop and everything should stop now in creation studio let
[30:47] should stop now in creation studio let
[30:47] should stop now in creation studio let me stop this one as well
[30:50] me stop this one as well
[30:50] me stop this one as well okay perfect
[30:54] okay perfect
[30:54] okay perfect let me now find i believe
[31:03] i have a directory here and my builds
[31:03] i have a directory here and my builds and in my install scripts
[31:05] and in my install scripts
[31:05] and in my install scripts uh install creation now that's not the
[31:08] uh install creation now that's not the
[31:08] uh install creation now that's not the right one
[31:09] right one
[31:09] right one just give me a second i'm looking for it
[31:11] just give me a second i'm looking for it
[31:11] just give me a second i'm looking for it maybe it's
[31:12] maybe it's
[31:12] maybe it's in this episode that i copied it
[31:15] in this episode that i copied it
[31:15] in this episode that i copied it uh postgrad database install creatio
[31:25] no that's not the one uh
[31:25] no that's not the one uh one second install creation
[31:28] one second install creation
[31:28] one second install creation let me see if this is the one
[31:39] right so what we're trying to do here
[31:39] right so what we're trying to do here is we're trying to create an application
[31:42] is we're trying to create an application
[31:42] is we're trying to create an application pool
[31:43] pool
[31:43] pool or we're trying to create essentially a
[31:45] or we're trying to create essentially a
[31:45] or we're trying to create essentially a powershell
[31:46] powershell
[31:46] powershell script that helps us with the database
[31:50] script that helps us with the database
[31:50] script that helps us with the database so before we we did quite a lot of steps
[31:53] so before we we did quite a lot of steps
[31:53] so before we we did quite a lot of steps manually here
[31:54] manually here
[31:54] manually here and what we're going to try to do now is
[31:57] and what we're going to try to do now is
[31:57] and what we're going to try to do now is we're going to try to
[31:58] we're going to try to
[31:58] we're going to try to build the same thing but now with the
[32:00] build the same thing but now with the
[32:00] build the same thing but now with the help of the
[32:02] help of the
[32:02] help of the with the help of powershell script now
[32:04] with the help of powershell script now
[32:04] with the help of powershell script now let's uh
[32:05] let's uh
[32:06] let's uh explore some of the infrastructure that
[32:07] explore some of the infrastructure that
[32:07] explore some of the infrastructure that i kind of alluded to before but i
[32:09] i kind of alluded to before but i
[32:09] i kind of alluded to before but i haven't really shown it to you
[32:11] haven't really shown it to you
[32:11] haven't really shown it to you so in my docker i have a couple of
[32:14] so in my docker i have a couple of
[32:14] so in my docker i have a couple of containers running so as soon as it
[32:15] containers running so as soon as it
[32:15] containers running so as soon as it starts
[32:16] starts
[32:16] starts you'll see that i have exchange sync
[32:18] you'll see that i have exchange sync
[32:18] you'll see that i have exchange sync running this is the exchange listener
[32:20] running this is the exchange listener
[32:20] running this is the exchange listener container
[32:20] container
[32:20] container i got a redis running and i got a
[32:22] i got a redis running and i got a
[32:22] i got a redis running and i got a postgrad database running here
[32:24] postgrad database running here
[32:24] postgrad database running here as well now the postgrad database
[32:27] as well now the postgrad database
[32:27] as well now the postgrad database contains
[32:28] contains
[32:28] contains two containers actually one is just the
[32:31] two containers actually one is just the
[32:31] two containers actually one is just the actual postgrad database itself so
[32:33] actual postgrad database itself so
[32:33] actual postgrad database itself so that's the thing that
[32:35] that's the thing that
[32:35] that's the thing that stores the data and allows for
[32:37] stores the data and allows for
[32:37] stores the data and allows for persistent data storage
[32:38] persistent data storage
[32:38] persistent data storage but then i'm also running a separate
[32:40] but then i'm also running a separate
[32:40] but then i'm also running a separate container for pg admin and the pg admin
[32:43] container for pg admin and the pg admin
[32:43] container for pg admin and the pg admin is the container that allows me to
[32:45] is the container that allows me to
[32:45] is the container that allows me to manage my
[32:46] manage my
[32:46] manage my postgrad database with the gui rather
[32:48] postgrad database with the gui rather
[32:48] postgrad database with the gui rather than with the command mode
[32:50] than with the command mode
[32:50] than with the command mode now you can tell that i've exposed port
[32:52] now you can tell that i've exposed port
[32:52] now you can tell that i've exposed port 8080 for
[32:54] 8080 for
[32:54] 8080 for pg admin i've exposed port 5432
[32:58] pg admin i've exposed port 5432
[32:58] pg admin i've exposed port 5432 for my database i've done the same thing
[33:00] for my database i've done the same thing
[33:00] for my database i've done the same thing for my redis and i exposed port 6379
[33:04] for my redis and i exposed port 6379
[33:04] for my redis and i exposed port 6379 and this is why i can connect from
[33:06] and this is why i can connect from
[33:06] and this is why i can connect from creation running in windows
[33:08] creation running in windows
[33:08] creation running in windows to redis running in a subsystem for
[33:11] to redis running in a subsystem for
[33:12] to redis running in a subsystem for linux on windows this is this is how i'm
[33:15] linux on windows this is this is how i'm
[33:15] linux on windows this is this is how i'm running my redis
[33:16] running my redis
[33:16] running my redis so if i simply navigate now to localhost
[33:18] so if i simply navigate now to localhost
[33:18] so if i simply navigate now to localhost port 8080
[33:19] port 8080
[33:19] port 8080 and let's try making make sure that it's
[33:22] and let's try making make sure that it's
[33:22] and let's try making make sure that it's actually work
[33:29] i will be greeted by my postgrad now
[33:29] i will be greeted by my postgrad now i've configured my username and password
[33:30] i've configured my username and password
[33:30] i've configured my username and password already so
[33:31] already so
[33:31] already so as soon as i connect i should be able oh
[33:33] as soon as i connect i should be able oh
[33:33] as soon as i connect i should be able oh there's an update great
[33:35] there's an update great
[33:35] there's an update great as soon as i connect i should be able to
[33:37] as soon as i connect i should be able to
[33:37] as soon as i connect i should be able to see my server and all my databases and
[33:40] see my server and all my databases and
[33:40] see my server and all my databases and whatever else i have here now with the
[33:42] whatever else i have here now with the
[33:42] whatever else i have here now with the help of this tool just like we did with
[33:44] help of this tool just like we did with
[33:44] help of this tool just like we did with the help of
[33:45] the help of
[33:45] the help of sql from window from microsoft
[33:48] sql from window from microsoft
[33:48] sql from window from microsoft with the help of postgrad we can also
[33:50] with the help of postgrad we can also
[33:50] with the help of postgrad we can also restore the database in exactly the same
[33:52] restore the database in exactly the same
[33:52] restore the database in exactly the same way
[33:52] way
[33:52] way if we want to go to database we can say
[33:54] if we want to go to database we can say
[33:54] if we want to go to database we can say create and once the database is created
[33:57] create and once the database is created
[33:57] create and once the database is created we can
[33:58] we can
[33:58] we can essentially come back here and we can
[34:00] essentially come back here and we can
[34:00] essentially come back here and we can restore the database so the process is
[34:02] restore the database so the process is
[34:02] restore the database so the process is exactly
[34:02] exactly
[34:02] exactly the same but rather than using uh
[34:06] the same but rather than using uh
[34:06] the same but rather than using uh this gui what i would rather do is i
[34:08] this gui what i would rather do is i
[34:08] this gui what i would rather do is i would rather not touch the gui at all
[34:09] would rather not touch the gui at all
[34:09] would rather not touch the gui at all and i want to make sure that i can
[34:11] and i want to make sure that i can
[34:11] and i want to make sure that i can install everything
[34:12] install everything
[34:12] install everything with the help of my um with the help of

[34:20] uh powershell so let me open uh visual studio and let me open this
[34:22] visual studio and let me open this
[34:22] visual studio and let me open this directory and i believe
[34:24] directory and i believe
[34:24] directory and i believe this is not the right place so let me
[34:25] this is not the right place so let me
[34:25] this is not the right place so let me just open this guy
[34:27] just open this guy
[34:27] just open this guy all right so
[34:30] all right so
[34:30] all right so what we're seeing here um yeah i think
[34:33] what we're seeing here um yeah i think
[34:33] what we're seeing here um yeah i think this is the right place
[34:34] this is the right place
[34:34] this is the right place uh and i will share all these scripts
[34:36] uh and i will share all these scripts
[34:36] uh and i will share all these scripts for you so what we're seeing here is
[34:38] for you so what we're seeing here is
[34:38] for you so what we're seeing here is inside this file we're gonna start
[34:41] inside this file we're gonna start
[34:41] inside this file we're gonna start installing the application
[34:43] installing the application
[34:43] installing the application now the partial script starts off with
[34:45] now the partial script starts off with
[34:45] now the partial script starts off with the couple of parameters it's asking for
[34:47] the couple of parameters it's asking for
[34:47] the couple of parameters it's asking for at the
[34:48] at the
[34:48] at the input so it says that i need to know the
[34:50] input so it says that i need to know the
[34:50] input so it says that i need to know the app name and i need to know the
[34:52] app name and i need to know the
[34:52] app name and i need to know the folder name some db user and the db
[34:54] folder name some db user and the db
[34:54] folder name some db user and the db password
[34:55] password
[34:55] password some ports and basically a bunch of
[34:57] some ports and basically a bunch of
[34:57] some ports and basically a bunch of other configurations that
[34:58] other configurations that
[34:58] other configurations that are necessary for me to install the
[35:01] are necessary for me to install the
[35:01] are necessary for me to install the application
[35:02] application
[35:02] application then we're gonna go and we're gonna
[35:03] then we're gonna go and we're gonna
[35:03] then we're gonna go and we're gonna start with the various installation
[35:05] start with the various installation
[35:05] start with the various installation steps so step one we need to make sure
[35:07] steps so step one we need to make sure
[35:07] steps so step one we need to make sure that we create the directory
[35:09] that we create the directory
[35:09] that we create the directory i'm taking simply the app name and i'm
[35:11] i'm taking simply the app name and i'm
[35:11] i'm taking simply the app name and i'm saying i'm gonna create this directory
[35:13] saying i'm gonna create this directory
[35:13] saying i'm gonna create this directory and i'm going to copy
[35:14] and i'm going to copy
[35:14] and i'm going to copy everything into that directory
[35:17] everything into that directory
[35:17] everything into that directory i'm then going to restore my powershell
[35:20] i'm then going to restore my powershell
[35:20] i'm then going to restore my powershell restore my
[35:23] restore my
[35:23] restore my database with the help of postgresql and
[35:27] database with the help of postgresql and
[35:27] database with the help of postgresql and here's how i'm restoring it so here's
[35:29] here's how i'm restoring it so here's
[35:29] here's how i'm restoring it so here's two steps to restore the database
[35:31] two steps to restore the database
[35:31] two steps to restore the database first we execute command in docker to
[35:33] first we execute command in docker to
[35:33] first we execute command in docker to make sure that we create the database
[35:35] make sure that we create the database
[35:35] make sure that we create the database and then we execute the command that we
[35:37] and then we execute the command that we
[35:37] and then we execute the command that we actually restore the database
[35:39] actually restore the database
[35:39] actually restore the database and i can go ahead and delete the
[35:40] and i can go ahead and delete the
[35:40] and i can go ahead and delete the database folder if i wanted to
[35:43] database folder if i wanted to
[35:43] database folder if i wanted to and then i can start configuring my
[35:44] and then i can start configuring my
[35:44] and then i can start configuring my connection string and here i'm parsing
[35:47] connection string and here i'm parsing
[35:47] connection string and here i'm parsing my connection string
[35:48] my connection string
[35:48] my connection string file i'm looking for the redis
[35:52] file i'm looking for the redis
[35:52] file i'm looking for the redis name and i'm just simply giving it a
[35:53] name and i'm just simply giving it a
[35:53] name and i'm just simply giving it a localhost radius
[35:55] localhost radius
[35:55] localhost radius a db number which i'm taking as a
[35:57] a db number which i'm taking as a
[35:57] a db number which i'm taking as a parameter into the script and i'm
[35:58] parameter into the script and i'm
[35:58] parameter into the script and i'm specifying the port
[36:00] specifying the port
[36:00] specifying the port i'm doing exactly the same thing to
[36:02] i'm doing exactly the same thing to
[36:02] i'm doing exactly the same thing to address the connection to the database
[36:04] address the connection to the database
[36:04] address the connection to the database and at this point my database is
[36:06] and at this point my database is
[36:06] and at this point my database is restored now in microsoft sql restoring
[36:09] restored now in microsoft sql restoring
[36:09] restored now in microsoft sql restoring the databases
[36:10] the databases
[36:10] the databases you saw takes no time at all maybe a
[36:12] you saw takes no time at all maybe a
[36:12] you saw takes no time at all maybe a second maybe two
[36:13] second maybe two
[36:13] second maybe two on postgre it takes quite a bit of time
[36:15] on postgre it takes quite a bit of time
[36:15] on postgre it takes quite a bit of time in my case it takes up to four minutes
[36:18] in my case it takes up to four minutes
[36:18] in my case it takes up to four minutes to restore database so if you're sitting
[36:19] to restore database so if you're sitting
[36:20] to restore database so if you're sitting there and you're thinking that nothing
[36:21] there and you're thinking that nothing
[36:21] there and you're thinking that nothing is happening
[36:22] is happening
[36:22] is happening things are happening it just it just
[36:24] things are happening it just it just
[36:24] things are happening it just it just takes significantly longer
[36:26] takes significantly longer
[36:26] takes significantly longer the next step for us is to create iis
[36:29] the next step for us is to create iis
[36:29] the next step for us is to create iis this
[36:30] this
[36:30] this uh or create the website and create the
[36:32] uh or create the website and create the
[36:32] uh or create the website and create the application pool
[36:33] application pool
[36:33] application pool these steps are exactly the same for ms
[36:36] these steps are exactly the same for ms
[36:36] these steps are exactly the same for ms sql installation as well as a postgrad
[36:39] sql installation as well as a postgrad
[36:39] sql installation as well as a postgrad i have install creation in this install
[36:41] i have install creation in this install
[36:41] i have install creation in this install script that i will share with you and
[36:43] script that i will share with you and
[36:43] script that i will share with you and this is for postgre i'll probably give
[36:44] this is for postgre i'll probably give
[36:44] this is for postgre i'll probably give it a proper name
[36:45] it a proper name
[36:45] it a proper name and then i believe there is an install
[36:47] and then i believe there is an install
[36:47] and then i believe there is an install script for
[36:49] script for
[36:49] script for sql and you could tell that the sql is
[36:51] sql and you could tell that the sql is
[36:51] sql and you could tell that the sql is slightly
[36:52] slightly
[36:52] slightly different and this is just to make sure
[36:54] different and this is just to make sure
[36:54] different and this is just to make sure that i am now restoring the database
[36:56] that i am now restoring the database
[36:56] that i am now restoring the database with ms sql
[36:57] with ms sql
[36:57] with ms sql but the rest of the script is it
[36:59] but the rest of the script is it
[36:59] but the rest of the script is it actually exactly the same
[37:01] actually exactly the same
[37:01] actually exactly the same so let's proceed with the installation
[37:03] so let's proceed with the installation
[37:03] so let's proceed with the installation take a look at what's happening here
[37:05] take a look at what's happening here
[37:05] take a look at what's happening here creatio register we're going to create a
[37:09] creatio register we're going to create a
[37:09] creatio register we're going to create a web app we're going to go and
[37:11] web app we're going to go and
[37:11] web app we're going to go and update clio because i'm going to be
[37:12] update clio because i'm going to be
[37:12] update clio because i'm going to be using clio to make sure that i can
[37:14] using clio to make sure that i can
[37:14] using clio to make sure that i can connect
[37:15] connect
[37:15] connect to my application then inside my
[37:17] to my application then inside my
[37:17] to my application then inside my application i'm going to install clio
[37:19] application i'm going to install clio
[37:19] application i'm going to install clio gate
[37:19] gate
[37:19] gate then i'm going to use clio to turn off
[37:22] then i'm going to use clio to turn off
[37:22] then i'm going to use clio to turn off these widgets
[37:24] these widgets
[37:24] these widgets for news i'm going to overwrite a couple
[37:25] for news i'm going to overwrite a couple
[37:25] for news i'm going to overwrite a couple of other settings i'm going to set up my
[37:28] of other settings i'm going to set up my
[37:28] of other settings i'm going to set up my default time zone to a particular value
[37:31] default time zone to a particular value
[37:31] default time zone to a particular value i'm going to override the user session
[37:33] i'm going to override the user session
[37:33] i'm going to override the user session value etc and i'm going to go and
[37:36] value etc and i'm going to go and
[37:36] value etc and i'm going to go and reconfigure a bunch of stuff here all
[37:39] reconfigure a bunch of stuff here all
[37:39] reconfigure a bunch of stuff here all with the help of clio
[37:40] with the help of clio
[37:40] with the help of clio and then at the end as soon as the clio
[37:42] and then at the end as soon as the clio
[37:42] and then at the end as soon as the clio is done
[37:43] is done
[37:43] is done reconfiguring my application all i want
[37:45] reconfiguring my application all i want
[37:45] reconfiguring my application all i want to do is i want to make sure that
[37:47] to do is i want to make sure that
[37:47] to do is i want to make sure that i start the process and navigate to this
[37:49] i start the process and navigate to this
[37:49] i start the process and navigate to this host and port
[37:50] host and port
[37:50] host and port now the way i launch it is perhaps not
[37:53] now the way i launch it is perhaps not
[37:53] now the way i launch it is perhaps not the way that
[37:54] the way that
[37:54] the way that you would launch it normally but i just
[37:56] you would launch it normally but i just
[37:56] you would launch it normally but i just find it a little bit easier inside
[37:58] find it a little bit easier inside
[37:58] find it a little bit easier inside visual studio
[37:59] visual studio
[37:59] visual studio to do it this way so inside my visual
[38:02] to do it this way so inside my visual
[38:02] to do it this way so inside my visual studio
[38:03] studio
[38:03] studio in the launcher json what i have is i
[38:05] in the launcher json what i have is i
[38:05] in the launcher json what i have is i have couple of launch files here
[38:08] have couple of launch files here
[38:08] have couple of launch files here so if you go inside the visual studio
[38:09] so if you go inside the visual studio
[38:09] so if you go inside the visual studio debugger you will see that you can
[38:11] debugger you will see that you can

[38:43] they're specific to my application
[38:43] they're specific to my application so let's go ahead and do that we're
[38:45] so let's go ahead and do that we're
[38:45] so let's go ahead and do that we're going to give it a
[38:47] going to give it a

[38:51] studio
[38:51] studio now one thing that uh be careful of
[38:54] now one thing that uh be careful of
[38:54] now one thing that uh be careful of is for some reason i found that
[38:59] is for some reason i found that
[38:59] is for some reason i found that if i call through powershell scripts my
[39:01] if i call through powershell scripts my
[39:01] if i call through powershell scripts my database with the uppercase
[39:03] database with the uppercase
[39:03] database with the uppercase letters then something is not working
[39:05] letters then something is not working
[39:05] letters then something is not working correctly and the database
[39:07] correctly and the database
[39:07] correctly and the database is always created in either lowercase or
[39:09] is always created in either lowercase or
[39:09] is always created in either lowercase or uppercase and
[39:10] uppercase and
[39:10] uppercase and it's probably something to do with my
[39:12] it's probably something to do with my
[39:12] it's probably something to do with my script but i couldn't figure out it
[39:13] script but i couldn't figure out it
[39:14] script but i couldn't figure out it real quick so if you want to use this
[39:16] real quick so if you want to use this
[39:16] real quick so if you want to use this script and you want to use these launch
[39:18] script and you want to use these launch
[39:18] script and you want to use these launch parameters then just make sure that
[39:20] parameters then just make sure that
[39:20] parameters then just make sure that everything is in the lower case
[39:22] everything is in the lower case
[39:22] everything is in the lower case okay so folder name i will explain what
[39:24] okay so folder name i will explain what
[39:24] okay so folder name i will explain what that stuff is and how it works
[39:27] that stuff is and how it works
[39:27] that stuff is and how it works but we're going to specify that to
[39:29] but we're going to specify that to
[39:29] but we're going to specify that to connect to my redis database is going to
[39:31] connect to my redis database is going to
[39:31] connect to my redis database is going to be a supervisor the password is also
[39:33] be a supervisor the password is also
[39:33] be a supervisor the password is also supervisor
[39:34] supervisor
[39:34] supervisor let's put it on the port 7020 just to
[39:38] let's put it on the port 7020 just to
[39:38] let's put it on the port 7020 just to make sure it lives there and the
[39:40] make sure it lives there and the
[39:40] make sure it lives there and the uh ms application was installed on redis
[39:44] uh ms application was installed on redis
[39:44] uh ms application was installed on redis 15 so let's give this red is 14.
[39:47] 15 so let's give this red is 14.
[39:47] 15 so let's give this red is 14. my redis port is 63.79

[39:53] and i'm using studio softkey backup file okay so now
[39:56] backup file okay so now
[39:56] backup file okay so now that i've configured my launcher
[39:58] that i've configured my launcher
[39:58] that i've configured my launcher essentially what the launcher file
[39:59] essentially what the launcher file
[39:59] essentially what the launcher file allows me to do is rather than
[40:01] allows me to do is rather than
[40:01] allows me to do is rather than typing this entire command by hand every
[40:04] typing this entire command by hand every
[40:04] typing this entire command by hand every time
[40:05] time
[40:05] time i can just simply now open my
[40:07] i can just simply now open my
[40:07] i can just simply now open my installation file and say
[40:09] installation file and say
[40:09] installation file and say apply these launcher settings okay and
[40:12] apply these launcher settings okay and
[40:12] apply these launcher settings okay and just simply go ahead and launch them
[40:14] just simply go ahead and launch them
[40:14] just simply go ahead and launch them it will start the powershell and visuals
[40:17] it will start the powershell and visuals
[40:17] it will start the powershell and visuals well not in visual studio but it will
[40:19] well not in visual studio but it will
[40:19] well not in visual studio but it will start an instance of my powershell and
[40:22] start an instance of my powershell and
[40:22] start an instance of my powershell and it will create me
[40:23] it will create me
[40:23] it will create me this application now what i realize is
[40:26] this application now what i realize is
[40:26] this application now what i realize is that i may have called my
[40:28] that i may have called my
[40:28] that i may have called my application pool and my website to
[40:32] application pool and my website to
[40:32] application pool and my website to very similar to what windows instance
[40:35] very similar to what windows instance
[40:35] very similar to what windows instance already has
[40:36] already has
[40:36] already has so it may or may not fail on me i didn't
[40:41] so it may or may not fail on me i didn't
[40:41] so it may or may not fail on me i didn't i didn't think of it but in the meantime
[40:43] i didn't think of it but in the meantime
[40:43] i didn't think of it but in the meantime while we're doing this or while visual
[40:45] while we're doing this or while visual
[40:45] while we're doing this or while visual studio is doing this and it's going to
[40:47] studio is doing this and it's going to
[40:47] studio is doing this and it's going to do it for a couple of minutes let's go
[40:48] do it for a couple of minutes let's go
[40:48] do it for a couple of minutes let's go and take a look how my infrastructure is
[40:50] and take a look how my infrastructure is
[40:50] and take a look how my infrastructure is laid out here
[40:52] laid out here
[40:52] laid out here so on my disk c when i built my
[40:56] so on my disk c when i built my
[40:56] so on my disk c when i built my docker files i've created couple of
[40:58] docker files i've created couple of
[40:58] docker files i've created couple of volumes
[40:59] volumes
[40:59] volumes i've got volumes that i'm passing to pg
[41:02] i've got volumes that i'm passing to pg
[41:02] i've got volumes that i'm passing to pg admin i've got volumes that i'm passing
[41:04] admin i've got volumes that i'm passing
[41:04] admin i've got volumes that i'm passing or
[41:05] or
[41:05] or disk space that i'm passing to
[41:06] disk space that i'm passing to
[41:06] disk space that i'm passing to postgresql
[41:08] postgresql
[41:08] postgresql and in postgrassclaw what you're seeing
[41:11] and in postgrassclaw what you're seeing
[41:11] and in postgrassclaw what you're seeing here is essentially what's on linux
[41:13] here is essentially what's on linux
[41:13] here is essentially what's on linux these files are called so this is inside
[41:15] these files are called so this is inside
[41:15] these files are called so this is inside the etsy directory and i don't remember
[41:17] the etsy directory and i don't remember
[41:17] the etsy directory and i don't remember the exact
[41:17] the exact
[41:17] the exact uh space uh the exact name of this
[41:19] uh space uh the exact name of this
[41:19] uh space uh the exact name of this directory but
[41:20] directory but
[41:20] directory but we got to look at the docker compose
[41:22] we got to look at the docker compose
[41:22] we got to look at the docker compose file so i'm passing it and essentially
[41:25] file so i'm passing it and essentially
[41:25] file so i'm passing it and essentially i can take a backup of this directory
[41:27] i can take a backup of this directory
[41:27] i can take a backup of this directory and this would represent backup of my
[41:29] and this would represent backup of my
[41:29] and this would represent backup of my entire server
[41:30] entire server
[41:30] entire server i've created myself files called db
[41:33] i've created myself files called db
[41:33] i've created myself files called db images
[41:34] images
[41:34] images db images are files that i'm using to
[41:37] db images are files that i'm using to
[41:37] db images are files that i'm using to restore my database
[41:38] restore my database
[41:38] restore my database just like in windows application you had
[41:40] just like in windows application you had
[41:40] just like in windows application you had a db folder
[41:42] a db folder
[41:42] a db folder when you're going to download a
[41:43] when you're going to download a
[41:43] when you're going to download a postgraph
[41:46] postgraph
[41:46] postgraph when you're going to download a postgrad
[41:48] when you're going to download a postgrad
[41:48] when you're going to download a postgrad file there's also going to be a db
[41:51] file there's also going to be a db
[41:51] file there's also going to be a db file now this db file is going to be
[41:53] file now this db file is going to be
[41:53] file now this db file is going to be obviously in different format and called
[41:55] obviously in different format and called
[41:55] obviously in different format and called something
[41:56] something
[41:56] something different so what i did is i essentially
[41:58] different so what i did is i essentially
[41:58] different so what i did is i essentially copied them all because i only need one
[42:00] copied them all because i only need one
[42:00] copied them all because i only need one per type of the application so if i want
[42:02] per type of the application so if i want
[42:02] per type of the application so if i want a studio
[42:03] a studio
[42:03] a studio it is always going to be the same backup
[42:05] it is always going to be the same backup
[42:05] it is always going to be the same backup file if i want a
[42:07] file if i want a
[42:07] file if i want a full bundle then it's also going to be
[42:09] full bundle then it's also going to be
[42:09] full bundle then it's also going to be exactly the same file for bundle so
[42:11] exactly the same file for bundle so
[42:11] exactly the same file for bundle so i just simply copied them and pre-copied
[42:13] i just simply copied them and pre-copied
[42:13] i just simply copied them and pre-copied them so i don't have to make sure that
[42:15] them so i don't have to make sure that
[42:15] them so i don't have to make sure that i'm copying the entire thing just kind
[42:17] i'm copying the entire thing just kind
[42:17] i'm copying the entire thing just kind of speeds things up a little bit
[42:19] of speeds things up a little bit
[42:19] of speeds things up a little bit so this is what this file name is okay
[42:23] so this is what this file name is okay
[42:23] so this is what this file name is okay now let's go back into our studio and
[42:25] now let's go back into our studio and
[42:25] now let's go back into our studio and take a look at what the studio is doing
[42:27] take a look at what the studio is doing
[42:27] take a look at what the studio is doing now
[42:28] now
[42:28] now so powershell is now trying to restore
[42:30] so powershell is now trying to restore
[42:30] so powershell is now trying to restore database and it essentially gotten to
[42:32] database and it essentially gotten to
[42:32] database and it essentially gotten to this point
[42:33] this point
[42:33] this point it gotten to a point of here creating
[42:36] it gotten to a point of here creating
[42:36] it gotten to a point of here creating the
[42:36] the
[42:36] the database right so it probably already
[42:38] database right so it probably already
[42:38] database right so it probably already created this process takes
[42:40] created this process takes
[42:40] created this process takes no time at all um this is really really
[42:42] no time at all um this is really really
[42:42] no time at all um this is really really fast and inexpensive
[42:44] fast and inexpensive
[42:44] fast and inexpensive but this takes some time so
[42:48] but this takes some time so
[42:48] but this takes some time so what are we doing here well the first
[42:50] what are we doing here well the first
[42:50] what are we doing here well the first thing when you're restoring a database
[42:52] thing when you're restoring a database
[42:52] thing when you're restoring a database is you need to create it now in ms
[42:54] is you need to create it now in ms
[42:54] is you need to create it now in ms we didn't have to do it but in postgre
[42:55] we didn't have to do it but in postgre
[42:56] we didn't have to do it but in postgre you first have to create a database give
[42:57] you first have to create a database give
[42:57] you first have to create a database give it a name
[42:58] it a name
[42:58] it a name specify some of the parameters and then
[43:00] specify some of the parameters and then
[43:00] specify some of the parameters and then you need to make sure that you're
[43:01] you need to make sure that you're
[43:02] you need to make sure that you're restoring it
[43:03] restoring it
[43:03] restoring it now granted that it's done that it's
[43:05] now granted that it's done that it's
[43:05] now granted that it's done that it's living in the docker so it's living
[43:07] living in the docker so it's living
[43:07] living in the docker so it's living inside this kind of a
[43:09] inside this kind of a
[43:09] inside this kind of a isolated environment we have to use a
[43:11] isolated environment we have to use a
[43:11] isolated environment we have to use a docker exact command out of the
[43:13] docker exact command out of the
[43:13] docker exact command out of the powershell to restore it now there are
[43:15] powershell to restore it now there are
[43:15] powershell to restore it now there are other ways but i found that this is the
[43:17] other ways but i found that this is the
[43:17] other ways but i found that this is the easiest to get it going
[43:18] easiest to get it going
[43:18] easiest to get it going so all i'm saying here is docker go and
[43:21] so all i'm saying here is docker go and
[43:21] so all i'm saying here is docker go and execute some command in interactive mode
[43:24] execute some command in interactive mode
[43:24] execute some command in interactive mode i am addressing the container where my
[43:26] i am addressing the container where my
[43:26] i am addressing the container where my particular database lives
[43:27] particular database lives
[43:27] particular database lives i'm specifying the username or
[43:31] i'm specifying the username or
[43:31] i'm specifying the username or basically parameters how to restore it
[43:33] basically parameters how to restore it
[43:33] basically parameters how to restore it i'm saying no owner no privileges
[43:35] i'm saying no owner no privileges
[43:35] i'm saying no owner no privileges a couple of other keys and essentially
[43:37] a couple of other keys and essentially
[43:37] a couple of other keys and essentially here's my database
[43:38] here's my database
[43:38] here's my database name now where am i going to take this
[43:40] name now where am i going to take this
[43:40] name now where am i going to take this database name i'm going to take it yeah
[43:42] database name i'm going to take it yeah
[43:42] database name i'm going to take it yeah i'm going to take it from usr local db
[43:46] i'm going to take it from usr local db
[43:46] i'm going to take it from usr local db db file name now what we saw now is that
[43:49] db file name now what we saw now is that
[43:49] db file name now what we saw now is that i made a mistake and when i restored the
[43:53] i made a mistake and when i restored the
[43:53] i made a mistake and when i restored the database
[43:54] database
[43:54] database or when i gave the parameters to launch
[43:57] or when i gave the parameters to launch
[43:57] or when i gave the parameters to launch is i did not specify a unique name for
[44:00] is i did not specify a unique name for
[44:00] is i did not specify a unique name for my application server
[44:02] my application server
[44:02] my application server so this application server creation
[44:05] so this application server creation
[44:05] so this application server creation creation studio already exists
[44:07] creation studio already exists
[44:07] creation studio already exists so what we can do is say creatio studio
[44:10] so what we can do is say creatio studio
[44:10] so what we can do is say creatio studio p sql right so now that's going to be a
[44:14] p sql right so now that's going to be a
[44:14] p sql right so now that's going to be a unique name
[44:15] unique name
[44:15] unique name i just make sure we give it another
[44:18] i just make sure we give it another
[44:18] i just make sure we give it another i just for now i'll clean it up later
[44:20] i just for now i'll clean it up later
[44:20] i just for now i'll clean it up later but let's make sure that we do this
[44:23] but let's make sure that we do this
[44:23] but let's make sure that we do this 70 30. okay let's save this
[44:27] 70 30. okay let's save this
[44:27] 70 30. okay let's save this and let's try launching it one more time
[44:29] and let's try launching it one more time
[44:29] and let's try launching it one more time so the same way
[44:30] so the same way
[44:30] so the same way psql so now the name of my application
[44:34] psql so now the name of my application
[44:34] psql so now the name of my application the name of my uh
[44:37] the name of my uh
[44:38] the name of my uh the name of everything is essentially
[44:39] the name of everything is essentially
[44:39] the name of everything is essentially unique i
[44:41] unique i
[44:41] unique i cannot debug until the
[44:45] cannot debug until the
[44:45] cannot debug until the what until
[44:48] what until
[44:48] what until has started okay so i crashed the
[44:50] has started okay so i crashed the
[44:50] has started okay so i crashed the powershell
[44:51] powershell
[44:51] powershell so let's start a new one and let's see
[44:54] so let's start a new one and let's see
[44:54] so let's start a new one and let's see if you can launch
[44:55] if you can launch
[44:55] if you can launch in noaa
[44:58] in noaa
[44:58] in noaa okay let's see if we can add another
[45:01] okay let's see if we can add another
[45:01] okay let's see if we can add another instance of it
[45:03] instance of it
[45:03] instance of it can you launch now
[45:12] um okay let's close
[45:12] um okay let's close this one and let's reopen our studio one
[45:15] this one and let's reopen our studio one
[45:15] this one and let's reopen our studio one more time so
[45:17] more time so
[45:17] more time so sometimes this happens and that was my
[45:20] sometimes this happens and that was my
[45:20] sometimes this happens and that was my fault
[45:21] fault
[45:21] fault so back to where we were let's go back
[45:24] so back to where we were let's go back
[45:24] so back to where we were let's go back to
[45:24] to
[45:24] to installer let's go back to debugger and
[45:27] installer let's go back to debugger and
[45:27] installer let's go back to debugger and just simply
[45:28] just simply
[45:28] just simply launch it okay so now it's copying it to
[45:32] launch it okay so now it's copying it to
[45:32] launch it okay so now it's copying it to creation
[45:33] creation
[45:33] creation psql and what we can do is we can
[45:35] psql and what we can do is we can
[45:35] psql and what we can do is we can essentially go back to our
[45:37] essentially go back to our
[45:38] essentially go back to our local disk c and we can take a look at
[45:40] local disk c and we can take a look at
[45:40] local disk c and we can take a look at what was
[45:41] what was
[45:41] what was happening in the past so if we're going
[45:43] happening in the past so if we're going
[45:43] happening in the past so if we're going to go back to inet pub
[45:44] to go back to inet pub
[45:44] to go back to inet pub and we're going to go back in the root
[45:46] and we're going to go back in the root
[45:46] and we're going to go back in the root application you could tell that here's
[45:48] application you could tell that here's
[45:48] application you could tell that here's my creation studio
[45:49] my creation studio
[45:50] my creation studio and i just essentially copied everything
[45:51] and i just essentially copied everything
[45:51] and i just essentially copied everything into one directory so i made a
[45:53] into one directory so i made a
[45:53] into one directory so i made a i made a mistake here so a few things
[45:56] i made a mistake here so a few things
[45:56] i made a mistake here so a few things that i need to do
[45:58] that i need to do
[45:58] that i need to do when i am removing the application the
[46:00] when i am removing the application the
[46:00] when i am removing the application the first thing i would normally start off
[46:02] first thing i would normally start off
[46:02] first thing i would normally start off with
[46:03] with
[46:03] with is i'm going to go back to my ms into my
[46:05] is i'm going to go back to my ms into my
[46:05] is i'm going to go back to my ms into my iis
[46:06] iis
[46:06] iis inside my ass i could tell here's my
[46:08] inside my ass i could tell here's my
[46:08] inside my ass i could tell here's my creation studio
[46:10] creation studio
[46:10] creation studio and inside this creation studio i can
[46:12] and inside this creation studio i can
[46:12] and inside this creation studio i can just simply
[46:13] just simply
[46:13] just simply delete this thing i can right click on
[46:15] delete this thing i can right click on
[46:15] delete this thing i can right click on it and i can delete it
[46:17] it and i can delete it
[46:17] it and i can delete it if a machine allows me but before i
[46:20] if a machine allows me but before i
[46:20] if a machine allows me but before i delete it
[46:22] delete it
[46:22] delete it yes i'm sure i want to delete it
[46:25] yes i'm sure i want to delete it
[46:25] yes i'm sure i want to delete it before you delete it make sure that
[46:27] before you delete it make sure that
[46:27] before you delete it make sure that you're deleting actually the right one
[46:29] you're deleting actually the right one
[46:29] you're deleting actually the right one you might have a ton of applications
[46:30] you might have a ton of applications
[46:30] you might have a ton of applications here and now we're ready to come back
[46:33] here and now we're ready to come back
[46:33] here and now we're ready to come back here to creation studio application pool
[46:35] here to creation studio application pool
[46:35] here to creation studio application pool and delete this thing as well
[46:37] and delete this thing as well
[46:37] and delete this thing as well so let's remove this one as well now
[46:40] so let's remove this one as well now
[46:40] so let's remove this one as well now everything is
[46:41] everything is
[46:41] everything is fine here but um what you need to know
[46:43] fine here but um what you need to know
[46:43] fine here but um what you need to know about
[46:44] about
[46:44] about is that under your users directory
[46:47] is that under your users directory
[46:47] is that under your users directory usually
[46:48] usually
[46:48] usually depending on how your machine is
[46:50] depending on how your machine is
[46:50] depending on how your machine is configured you may also get an
[46:52] configured you may also get an
[46:52] configured you may also get an application
[46:53] application
[46:53] application you may also get a directory for your
[46:55] you may also get a directory for your
[46:55] you may also get a directory for your user for every application pool
[46:57] user for every application pool
[46:57] user for every application pool so the way my machine is configured in
[46:59] so the way my machine is configured in
[46:59] so the way my machine is configured in particular
[47:00] particular
[47:00] particular every time i'm adding in the app pool it
[47:02] every time i'm adding in the app pool it
[47:02] every time i'm adding in the app pool it creates a directory for this user
[47:04] creates a directory for this user
[47:04] creates a directory for this user and then happens to be about 200
[47:05] and then happens to be about 200
[47:06] and then happens to be about 200 megabytes or maybe even 500 megabytes if
[47:09] megabytes or maybe even 500 megabytes if
[47:09] megabytes or maybe even 500 megabytes if i'm whoa that's huge actually
[47:12] i'm whoa that's huge actually
[47:12] i'm whoa that's huge actually so what you may want to do is you want
[47:15] so what you may want to do is you want
[47:15] so what you may want to do is you want to make sure
[47:16] to make sure
[47:16] to make sure that when you're deleting the
[47:18] that when you're deleting the
[47:18] that when you're deleting the application that
[47:20] application that
[47:20] application that things are simply dis that you're
[47:22] things are simply dis that you're
[47:22] things are simply dis that you're deleting them
[47:23] deleting them
[47:23] deleting them if you install it 10 or 15 times i mean
[47:25] if you install it 10 or 15 times i mean
[47:25] if you install it 10 or 15 times i mean 5 gigs is not that much
[47:28] 5 gigs is not that much
[47:28] 5 gigs is not that much but what you may want to make sure off
[47:29] but what you may want to make sure off
[47:29] but what you may want to make sure off is that you actually go and delete it
[47:31] is that you actually go and delete it
[47:31] is that you actually go and delete it right because this is junk right now
[47:33] right because this is junk right now
[47:33] right because this is junk right now this user doesn't exist
[47:35] this user doesn't exist
[47:35] this user doesn't exist it was created for us when
[47:38] it was created for us when
[47:38] it was created for us when the application was added and now we
[47:40] the application was added and now we
[47:40] the application was added and now we just cleaned up and
[47:41] just cleaned up and
[47:41] just cleaned up and now everything is fine now don't delete
[47:43] now everything is fine now don't delete
[47:43] now everything is fine now don't delete too much
[47:44] too much
[47:44] too much this is my actual user don't delete
[47:46] this is my actual user don't delete
[47:46] this is my actual user don't delete temps and
[47:48] temps and
[47:48] temps and these might be actually useful for you
[47:50] these might be actually useful for you
[47:50] these might be actually useful for you just make sure that you only delete
[47:52] just make sure that you only delete
[47:52] just make sure that you only delete things that
[47:52] things that
[47:52] things that you want to delete okay there is nothing

[47:58] um the other thing that we may want to do is we may want to
[47:59] do is we may want to
[47:59] do is we may want to uh just free up a few resources so we're
[48:02] uh just free up a few resources so we're
[48:02] uh just free up a few resources so we're going to go to
[48:03] going to go to
[48:03] going to go to sql service and since i'm not using a ms
[48:05] sql service and since i'm not using a ms
[48:05] sql service and since i'm not using a ms sql
[48:06] sql
[48:06] sql on my local environment i'm going to go
[48:09] on my local environment i'm going to go
[48:09] on my local environment i'm going to go and
[48:09] and
[48:09] and stop this application here
[48:12] stop this application here
[48:12] stop this application here so let's search for sql
[48:16] so let's search for sql
[48:16] so let's search for sql sql server and i can just simply stop it
[48:20] sql server and i can just simply stop it
[48:20] sql server and i can just simply stop it i no longer want to use it and i believe
[48:23] i no longer want to use it and i believe
[48:23] i no longer want to use it and i believe this one agent is also running
[48:26] this one agent is also running
[48:26] this one agent is also running this will free up maybe i don't know
[48:29] this will free up maybe i don't know
[48:29] this will free up maybe i don't know half a gig of ram
[48:31] half a gig of ram
[48:31] half a gig of ram uh not much but if you're on limited
[48:34] uh not much but if you're on limited
[48:34] uh not much but if you're on limited resources that that might actually
[48:37] resources that that might actually
[48:37] resources that that might actually make significant changes okay so now you
[48:39] make significant changes okay so now you
[48:39] make significant changes okay so now you could tell that here's my creation
[48:41] could tell that here's my creation
[48:41] could tell that here's my creation studio psql so this is the
[48:43] studio psql so this is the
[48:43] studio psql so this is the one that is being installed but then
[48:46] one that is being installed but then
[48:46] one that is being installed but then this
[48:46] this
[48:46] this creation studio we can just simply nuke
[48:49] creation studio we can just simply nuke
[48:49] creation studio we can just simply nuke this
[48:49] this
[48:50] this directory so the previous one that we
[48:52] directory so the previous one that we
[48:52] directory so the previous one that we used for
[48:53] used for
[48:53] used for microsoft windows now let's take a look
[48:56] microsoft windows now let's take a look
[48:56] microsoft windows now let's take a look at the application what the script is
[48:58] at the application what the script is
[48:58] at the application what the script is doing now
[48:59] doing now
[48:59] doing now um so created new app pool environment
[49:03] um so created new app pool environment
[49:03] um so created new app pool environment uh was configured try logging in so it's
[49:06] uh was configured try logging in so it's

[49:15] is being
[49:15] is being checked or updated
[49:19] checked or updated
[49:19] checked or updated so clio is trying to uh here create clio
[49:22] so clio is trying to uh here create clio
[49:22] so clio is trying to uh here create clio was reinstalled to the latest
[49:24] was reinstalled to the latest
[49:24] was reinstalled to the latest version clio is our command line
[49:26] version clio is our command line
[49:26] version clio is our command line interface
[49:27] interface
[49:27] interface now the first time you're trying to
[49:29] now the first time you're trying to
[49:29] now the first time you're trying to connect to clear this will take some
[49:31] connect to clear this will take some
[49:32] connect to clear this will take some time
[49:32] time
[49:32] time and that's because well the application
[49:34] and that's because well the application
[49:34] and that's because well the application actually needs to start
[49:36] actually needs to start
[49:36] actually needs to start um start something and as soon as the
[49:39] um start something and as soon as the
[49:39] um start something and as soon as the clio
[49:40] clio
[49:40] clio was able to connect it's going to try to

[50:01] specifying your cultures configuring
[50:01] specifying your cultures configuring many many different things
[50:02] many many different things
[50:02] many many different things and essentially everything and anything
[50:04] and essentially everything and anything
[50:04] and essentially everything and anything and everything about creation can be
[50:05] and everything about creation can be
[50:06] and everything about creation can be done
[50:06] done
[50:06] done with clio so sometimes you'll see the
[50:09] with clio so sometimes you'll see the
[50:09] with clio so sometimes you'll see the remote server return errors that's
[50:11] remote server return errors that's
[50:11] remote server return errors that's that's fine um all we're doing now is
[50:14] that's fine um all we're doing now is
[50:14] that's fine um all we're doing now is we're configuring system
[50:15] we're configuring system
[50:15] we're configuring system settings you could see that they're all
[50:17] settings you could see that they're all
[50:17] settings you could see that they're all being updated i'm
[50:19] being updated i'm
[50:19] being updated i'm turning things on and turning things off
[50:21] turning things on and turning things off
[50:21] turning things on and turning things off i am installing
[50:22] i am installing
[50:22] i am installing setting myself to debug mode and then at
[50:25] setting myself to debug mode and then at
[50:25] setting myself to debug mode and then at this point
[50:26] this point
[50:26] this point my application is completed
[50:29] my application is completed
[50:29] my application is completed i'm gonna try to log on with the
[50:31] i'm gonna try to log on with the
[50:31] i'm gonna try to log on with the supervisor
[50:33] supervisor
[50:33] supervisor supervisor i'm logging on you could tell
[50:36] supervisor i'm logging on you could tell
[50:36] supervisor i'm logging on you could tell that there is no more this
[50:38] that there is no more this
[50:38] that there is no more this widget that tells me things about the
[50:40] widget that tells me things about the
[50:40] widget that tells me things about the news anymore
[50:42] news anymore
[50:42] news anymore so that's gone and there are going to be
[50:44] so that's gone and there are going to be
[50:44] so that's gone and there are going to be a couple of other notable differences
[50:46] a couple of other notable differences
[50:46] a couple of other notable differences as soon as my application is installed
[50:48] as soon as my application is installed
[50:48] as soon as my application is installed you see it's in the debug mode
[50:49] you see it's in the debug mode
[50:50] you see it's in the debug mode if i go into my profile you will also
[50:52] if i go into my profile you will also
[50:52] if i go into my profile you will also see that
[50:53] see that
[50:53] see that i have my language configured for myself
[50:56] i have my language configured for myself
[50:56] i have my language configured for myself as well as the default time zone for all
[50:59] as well as the default time zone for all
[50:59] as well as the default time zone for all users
[50:59] users
[50:59] users now all i have to do is just simply
[51:01] now all i have to do is just simply
[51:01] now all i have to do is just simply choose my date time format if i so
[51:03] choose my date time format if i so
[51:03] choose my date time format if i so choose
[51:04] choose
[51:04] choose and my time zone but i'm happy with the
[51:06] and my time zone but i'm happy with the
[51:06] and my time zone but i'm happy with the default configurations that
[51:08] default configurations that
[51:08] default configurations that that are applied so essentially at this
[51:10] that are applied so essentially at this
[51:10] that are applied so essentially at this point everything is configured
[51:13] point everything is configured
[51:13] point everything is configured as well as the exchange listener so if
[51:15] as well as the exchange listener so if
[51:15] as well as the exchange listener so if we wanted to simply go
[51:17] we wanted to simply go
[51:17] we wanted to simply go and let's see if we can add
[51:20] and let's see if we can add
[51:20] and let's see if we can add an email really quickly
[51:30] so let's go into go to mailbox settings
[51:30] so let's go into go to mailbox settings let's create a mailbox and i'm going to
[51:32] let's create a mailbox and i'm going to
[51:32] let's create a mailbox and i'm going to add
[51:33] add
[51:33] add my work email
[51:37] my work email
[51:37] my work email and that's going to be office 365.
[51:47] i'm going to provide my username and
[51:47] i'm going to provide my username and password
[51:48] password
[51:48] password and if everything is installed correctly
[51:51] and if everything is installed correctly
[51:51] and if everything is installed correctly then i should be able to connect
[51:53] then i should be able to connect
[51:53] then i should be able to connect perfect uh it's been successfully added
[51:55] perfect uh it's been successfully added
[51:55] perfect uh it's been successfully added so now i know my exchange listener
[51:57] so now i know my exchange listener
[51:57] so now i know my exchange listener is also connected to this instance and
[52:00] is also connected to this instance and
[52:00] is also connected to this instance and i'm going to go and immediately
[52:01] i'm going to go and immediately
[52:01] i'm going to go and immediately change my settings as i do not wish for
[52:04] change my settings as i do not wish for
[52:04] change my settings as i do not wish for any emails to be downloaded
[52:06] any emails to be downloaded
[52:06] any emails to be downloaded right so you can just go ahead and
[52:08] right so you can just go ahead and
[52:08] right so you can just go ahead and configure email or go
[52:10] configure email or go
[52:10] configure email or go through the exchange listener
[52:11] through the exchange listener
[52:11] through the exchange listener configuration so
[52:14] configuration so
[52:14] configuration so this is essentially how you would
[52:15] this is essentially how you would
[52:15] this is essentially how you would configure
[52:17] configure
[52:17] configure creatio to run for the first time
[52:21] creatio to run for the first time
[52:21] creatio to run for the first time on the new instance of the application
[52:24] on the new instance of the application
[52:24] on the new instance of the application now just for good measure
[52:25] now just for good measure
[52:26] now just for good measure since we're in the debug mode already
[52:27] since we're in the debug mode already
[52:28] since we're in the debug mode already let's click on this button
[52:29] let's click on this button
[52:29] let's click on this button let's make sure that we can also perform
[52:31] let's make sure that we can also perform
[52:31] let's make sure that we can also perform this step to recompile our application
[52:34] this step to recompile our application
[52:34] this step to recompile our application just to make sure that nothing is broken
[52:36] just to make sure that nothing is broken
[52:36] just to make sure that nothing is broken and if application compiles
[52:38] and if application compiles
[52:38] and if application compiles installs and compiles and we know
[52:41] installs and compiles and we know
[52:41] installs and compiles and we know everything has been
[52:42] everything has been
[52:42] everything has been installed successfully so let's give it
[52:45] installed successfully so let's give it
[52:45] installed successfully so let's give it a
[52:45] a
[52:45] a let's give it a moment hopefully it's
[52:46] let's give it a moment hopefully it's
[52:46] let's give it a moment hopefully it's not going to be too long
[52:58] in terms of performance if you're
[52:58] in terms of performance if you're wondering what's faster
[53:00] wondering what's faster
[53:00] wondering what's faster running it in windows with ms running it
[53:03] running it in windows with ms running it
[53:03] running it in windows with ms running it on windows
[53:04] on windows
[53:04] on windows with postgrain docker postgre natively

[53:08] installed on windows
[53:08] installed on windows um perhaps i'm not the best judge
[53:11] um perhaps i'm not the best judge
[53:11] um perhaps i'm not the best judge uh i can't tell you uh what's faster
[53:14] uh i can't tell you uh what's faster
[53:14] uh i can't tell you uh what's faster what's better
[53:15] what's better
[53:15] what's better i found that it's just as lightning fast
[53:18] i found that it's just as lightning fast
[53:18] i found that it's just as lightning fast in one uh technology as it is with the
[53:21] in one uh technology as it is with the
[53:21] in one uh technology as it is with the other
[53:22] other

[54:30] i want to go to my public and i want to go into my tables
[54:31] go into my tables
[54:31] go into my tables here's a list of all the tables and it
[54:33] here's a list of all the tables and it
[54:33] here's a list of all the tables and it gives you all the same features
[54:35] gives you all the same features
[54:35] gives you all the same features as before you've got here under uh tools
[54:38] as before you've got here under uh tools
[54:38] as before you've got here under uh tools i believe
[54:39] i believe
[54:39] i believe uh query tool and from the query tool
[54:42] uh query tool and from the query tool
[54:42] uh query tool and from the query tool you can
[54:42] you can
[54:42] you can query whatever you want so let's just
[54:44] query whatever you want so let's just
[54:44] query whatever you want so let's just say that we want to query something
[54:47] say that we want to query something
[54:47] say that we want to query something select id from
[54:50] select id from
[54:50] select id from and i believe it's called public dot um
[54:54] and i believe it's called public dot um
[54:54] and i believe it's called public dot um contact if i'm not mistaken
[55:02] uh id i think
[55:02] uh id i think everything needs to be in single quotes
[55:05] everything needs to be in single quotes
[55:05] everything needs to be in single quotes here
[55:06] here
[55:06] here i think from public
[55:10] i think from public
[55:10] i think from public contact that's weird
[55:13] contact that's weird
[55:13] contact that's weird select id from
[55:19] public contact that's uh that looks
[55:19] public contact that's uh that looks right
[55:21] right
[55:21] right uh maybe i need that oh no hold on it
[55:24] uh maybe i need that oh no hold on it
[55:24] uh maybe i need that oh no hold on it needs to be double quotes
[55:27] needs to be double quotes
[55:27] needs to be double quotes right double or single well whichever
[55:30] right double or single well whichever
[55:30] right double or single well whichever way
[55:30] way
[55:30] way uh i don't spend a lot of time here
[55:35] uh i don't spend a lot of time here
[55:35] uh i don't spend a lot of time here select id
[55:42] okay so there we go so everything needs
[55:42] okay so there we go so everything needs to be escaped with double quotes
[55:44] to be escaped with double quotes
[55:44] to be escaped with double quotes um so this is kind of unfortunate way of
[55:48] um so this is kind of unfortunate way of
[55:48] um so this is kind of unfortunate way of that we need to address p sql but
[55:52] that we need to address p sql but
[55:52] that we need to address p sql but this is the only difference that
[55:55] this is the only difference that
[55:55] this is the only difference that probably you're going to care about
[55:57] probably you're going to care about
[55:57] probably you're going to care about if you get to work with psql and most of
[55:59] if you get to work with psql and most of
[55:59] if you get to work with psql and most of the time when you're doing development
[56:01] the time when you're doing development
[56:01] the time when you're doing development you
[56:01] you
[56:01] you quite honestly don't care all right so
