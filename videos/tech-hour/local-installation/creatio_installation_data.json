pre-production doesn't matter we're just pre-production doesn't matter we're just going to take a look at some of the going to take a look at some of the going to take a look at some of the required steps what you're seeing on the required steps what you're seeing on the required steps what you're seeing on the screen now screen now screen now is i have navigated to creatio is i have navigated to creatio is i have navigated to creatio or i've navigated to academy or i've navigated to academy or i've navigated to academy creation.com and i went into a creation.com and i went into a creation.com and i went into a documentation section so if you just documentation section so if you just documentation section so if you just simply click on this documentation simply click on this documentation simply click on this documentation button button button you will be greeted with a lot of you will be greeted with a lot of you will be greeted with a lot of documentation documentation documentation towards the bottom of the page you will towards the bottom of the page you will towards the bottom of the page you will be able to find documentation on setup be able to find documentation on setup be able to find documentation on setup and administration and administration and administration right here and if you come here on the right here and if you come here on the right here and if you come here on the left hand side left hand side left hand side you will find a way to deploy here is a you will find a way to deploy here is a you will find a way to deploy here is a link that will follow and in this case link that will follow and in this case link that will follow and in this case we're going to be following on-site we're going to be following on-site we're going to be following on-site deployment instructions deployment instructions deployment instructions now there are a couple of instructions now there are a couple of instructions now there are a couple of instructions or is the documentation is broken down or is the documentation is broken down or is the documentation is broken down into multiple sections into multiple sections into multiple sections just to make it a little bit easier so just to make it a little bit easier so just to make it a little bit easier so we're going to cover one by one we're going to cover one by one we're going to cover one by one let's start off with system requirements let's start off with system requirements let's start off with system requirements system requirements broken down into system requirements broken down into system requirements broken down into client and server side and client will client and server side and client will client and server side and client will skip for now but essentially skip for now but essentially skip for now but essentially you need to make sure that you have a you need to make sure that you have a you need to make sure that you have a modern browser now modern browser now modern browser now in here in system requirements this is in here in system requirements this is in here in system requirements this is where the more difficult part starts where the more difficult part starts where the more difficult part starts the article goes into details explaining the article goes into details explaining the article goes into details explaining various possible installation options various possible installation options various possible installation options and it's listing uh some deployment and it's listing uh some deployment and it's listing uh some deployment ideas here where you have ideas here where you have ideas here where you have dotnet application or iis is server dotnet application or iis is server dotnet application or iis is server you've got a database could be ms sql it you've got a database could be ms sql it you've got a database could be ms sql it could be a postgrad could be a postgrad could be a postgrad it could be oracle and a third component it could be oracle and a third component it could be oracle and a third component a minimum component a minimum component a minimum component redis and this constitutes a minimum redis and this constitutes a minimum redis and this constitutes a minimum required required required components that are necessary to run components that are necessary to run components that are necessary to run creation creation creation so redis iis and a database of your so redis iis and a database of your so redis iis and a database of your choice choice choice there are more difficult and more there are more difficult and more there are more difficult and more challenging challenging challenging installations for example when you want installations for example when you want installations for example when you want to go in the farm when you want to go to go in the farm when you want to go to go in the farm when you want to go load balancer when you want to run redis load balancer when you want to run redis load balancer when you want to run redis in the cluster in the cluster in the cluster you can configure your installation in you can configure your installation in you can configure your installation in that way but for our purposes for today that way but for our purposes for today that way but for our purposes for today for simple development machine for simple development machine for simple development machine pre-production pre-production pre-production we're not going to be going with the we're not going to be going with the we're not going to be going with the installation of farm as it's fairly installation of farm as it's fairly installation of farm as it's fairly technical and it's fairly specific to technical and it's fairly specific to technical and it's fairly specific to your particular application your particular application your particular application so let's scroll down and see what we so let's scroll down and see what we so let's scroll down and see what we need to do there's a lot of text here need to do there's a lot of text here need to do there's a lot of text here but i'm just going to take you to the but i'm just going to take you to the but i'm just going to take you to the most interesting parts most interesting parts most interesting parts the first part is we need to make sure the first part is we need to make sure the first part is we need to make sure that our servers or the underlying os that our servers or the underlying os that our servers or the underlying os that we want to install is supported now that we want to install is supported now that we want to install is supported now here we see that the here we see that the here we see that the server windows server 2012 and up are server windows server 2012 and up are server windows server 2012 and up are supported however supported however supported however windows 10 is also supported now in our windows 10 is also supported now in our windows 10 is also supported now in our example today i will be using windows 10 example today i will be using windows 10 example today i will be using windows 10 machine for the deployment but you could machine for the deployment but you could machine for the deployment but you could use use use windows 10 i believe even earlier windows 10 i believe even earlier windows 10 i believe even earlier versions will also work if you versions will also work if you versions will also work if you run them now we can install it on linux run them now we can install it on linux run them now we can install it on linux in debian but we're not going to be in debian but we're not going to be in debian but we're not going to be using it using it using it for now most of the people will be for now most of the people will be for now most of the people will be installing it on linux on installing it on linux on installing it on linux on on windows not on linux and so we're on windows not on linux and so we're on windows not on linux and so we're going to address going to address going to address this part first in order for us to this part first in order for us to this part first in order for us to deploy deploy deploy creation we need to first make sure that creation we need to first make sure that creation we need to first make sure that our windows machine complies with all our windows machine complies with all our windows machine complies with all the the the requirements so let's go into uh requirements so let's go into uh requirements so let's go into uh deploying creation.net framework deploying creation.net framework deploying creation.net framework application on windows let's follow this application on windows let's follow this application on windows let's follow this link link link when we follow this link we'll see that when we follow this link we'll see that when we follow this link we'll see that some requirements some requirements some requirements or some packages we need to install we or some packages we need to install we or some packages we need to install we need to make sure that we install need to make sure that we install need to make sure that we install net core sdk 3.1 and that we install net core sdk 3.1 and that we install net core sdk 3.1 and that we install framework sdk472 framework sdk472 framework sdk472 this will be required for our this will be required for our this will be required for our application server to compile your application server to compile your application server to compile your source code or to compile the source code or to compile the source code or to compile the application do many application do many application do many many tasks that we when we run wizards many tasks that we when we run wizards many tasks that we when we run wizards etc etc etc now there's also a bunch of requirements now there's also a bunch of requirements now there's also a bunch of requirements here on the windows component side here on the windows component side here on the windows component side and this is what we're going to and this is what we're going to and this is what we're going to concentrate on now if you need to concentrate on now if you need to concentrate on now if you need to download your sdks just make sure you download your sdks just make sure you download your sdks just make sure you follow the link and follow the link and follow the link and click through the installation guide click through the installation guide click through the installation guide provided by microsoft provided by microsoft provided by microsoft and these sdks will be installed most and these sdks will be installed most and these sdks will be installed most likely your machine will need to be likely your machine will need to be likely your machine will need to be restarted or rebooted at least once when restarted or rebooted at least once when restarted or rebooted at least once when you're installing it so please take some you're installing it so please take some you're installing it so please take some time time time there's also another dot net core is there's also another dot net core is there's also another dot net core is decade that is required if you decade that is required if you decade that is required if you want to run identity service you need want to run identity service you need want to run identity service you need dotnet core dotnet core dotnet core 2.2 so you're also going to have to go 2.2 so you're also going to have to go 2.2 so you're also going to have to go and install it and i'll show you and install it and i'll show you and install it and i'll show you how to do that later in this tutorial how to do that later in this tutorial how to do that later in this tutorial and here we see that the windows 10 is and here we see that the windows 10 is and here we see that the windows 10 is not not not a production grade os and yet a production grade os and yet a production grade os and yet it's still supported so let's take a it's still supported so let's take a it's still supported so let's take a look at these common features and let's look at these common features and let's look at these common features and let's take a look at the components that take a look at the components that take a look at the components that windows machine needs to have installed windows machine needs to have installed windows machine needs to have installed prior to trying to or attempting to prior to trying to or attempting to prior to trying to or attempting to install creation install creation install creation so on the left hand side the features so on the left hand side the features so on the left hand side the features are broken down into are broken down into are broken down into the related components into groups and the related components into groups and the related components into groups and on the right hand side on the right hand side on the right hand side is the name of the component itself in is the name of the component itself in is the name of the component itself in order for you to install these order for you to install these order for you to install these components you need to navigate to components you need to navigate to components you need to navigate to control panel and control panel and control panel and activate them this is what i'm going to activate them this is what i'm going to activate them this is what i'm going to do so on my windows machine i'll just do so on my windows machine i'll just do so on my windows machine i'll just press start button and say control panel press start button and say control panel press start button and say control panel and go to my control panel and go to my control panel and go to my control panel and here we can go inside the programs and here we can go inside the programs and here we can go inside the programs and in the middle there is going to be and in the middle there is going to be and in the middle there is going to be turn turn turn windows features on and off this is the windows features on and off this is the windows features on and off this is the screen that we want to get to screen that we want to get to screen that we want to get to now depending on what you already have now depending on what you already have now depending on what you already have installed or what rights you have on installed or what rights you have on installed or what rights you have on your machine you may your machine you may your machine you may have some of these components installed have some of these components installed have some of these components installed make sure that your make sure that your make sure that your sdks.netcore.net frameworks are sdks.netcore.net frameworks are sdks.netcore.net frameworks are previously installed otherwise you will previously installed otherwise you will previously installed otherwise you will not be able to see these two checkboxes not be able to see these two checkboxes not be able to see these two checkboxes now it's time for me to install these now it's time for me to install these now it's time for me to install these components the installation is fairly components the installation is fairly components the installation is fairly straightforward as all you need to do is straightforward as all you need to do is straightforward as all you need to do is just simply find the component which is just simply find the component which is just simply find the component which is the most challenging part the most challenging part the most challenging part and then put a checkbox next to it so and then put a checkbox next to it so and then put a checkbox next to it so let's start off with this common http let's start off with this common http let's start off with this common http feature static content default content feature static content default content feature static content default content etc etc etc they're located under iis information they're located under iis information they're located under iis information services services services web web services or www services web web services or www services web web services or www services and then here are my components so and then here are my components so and then here are my components so application development common http application development common http application development common http features and inside these common http features and inside these common http features and inside these common http features features features are the actual component items that i'm are the actual component items that i'm are the actual component items that i'm looking for looking for looking for here is my static content here's my here is my static content here's my here is my static content here's my default default default document http error and redirection on document http error and redirection on document http error and redirection on the left the left the left it is up to you to make sure that you it is up to you to make sure that you it is up to you to make sure that you click through all of them click through all of them click through all of them and what i find sometimes people are not and what i find sometimes people are not and what i find sometimes people are not clicking through all of them or they clicking through all of them or they clicking through all of them or they think that they click through all of think that they click through all of think that they click through all of them them them and then something happens during the and then something happens during the and then something happens during the deployment and the application doesn't deployment and the application doesn't deployment and the application doesn't work work work just make sure that all these items are just make sure that all these items are just make sure that all these items are select and double check select and double check select and double check i will provide you with a powerful i will provide you with a powerful i will provide you with a powerful script later or as pow script later or as pow script later or as pow as attachment to this tutorial that you as attachment to this tutorial that you as attachment to this tutorial that you can run to make sure that all these can run to make sure that all these can run to make sure that all these components are activated components are activated components are activated i do however encourage you to do it by i do however encourage you to do it by i do however encourage you to do it by hand at least once so you have an hand at least once so you have an hand at least once so you have an understanding of how it's done without understanding of how it's done without understanding of how it's done without any automations any automations any automations now towards the bottom of this article now towards the bottom of this article now towards the bottom of this article you'll see that you have similar you'll see that you have similar you'll see that you have similar instructions provided how to go to instructions provided how to go to instructions provided how to go to control panel how to find them control panel how to find them control panel how to find them and then the instructions are offered and then the instructions are offered and then the instructions are offered for windows server installations as well for windows server installations as well for windows server installations as well as as as for xp for windows 10. for xp for windows 10. for xp for windows 10. now that we have installed all the now that we have installed all the now that we have installed all the necessary components it's time for us to necessary components it's time for us to necessary components it's time for us to move on to the installation of the move on to the installation of the move on to the installation of the actual actual actual application i've already downloaded application i've already downloaded application i've already downloaded the application you can take it wherever the application you can take it wherever the application you can take it wherever you are taking the you are taking the you are taking the uh the components of the application and uh the components of the application and uh the components of the application and what i'm going to do is what i'm going to do is what i'm going to do is i i've gotten the zip file that i i've gotten the zip file that i i've gotten the zip file that essentially contains everything that i essentially contains everything that i essentially contains everything that i need the backup to my database etc need the backup to my database etc need the backup to my database etc and i'm going to simply extract it here and i'm going to simply extract it here and i'm going to simply extract it here now i have a program called 7zip that now i have a program called 7zip that now i have a program called 7zip that allows me to allows me to allows me to to unzip files a little bit faster so to unzip files a little bit faster so to unzip files a little bit faster so i'm going to use i'm going to use i'm going to use 7-zip to extract files now i can extract 7-zip to extract files now i can extract 7-zip to extract files now i can extract files to a particular directory which is files to a particular directory which is files to a particular directory which is what i'm intending to do what i'm intending to do what i'm intending to do or you can just simply dump them in the or you can just simply dump them in the or you can just simply dump them in the entire directory entire directory entire directory okay so now that my installation or that okay so now that my installation or that okay so now that my installation or that my extraction is completed it's time for my extraction is completed it's time for my extraction is completed it's time for us to start playing around with that us to start playing around with that us to start playing around with that various components various components various components now i have some components installed as now i have some components installed as now i have some components installed as part of the infrastructure inside docker part of the infrastructure inside docker part of the infrastructure inside docker container container container namely i'm using my redis as the namely i'm using my redis as the namely i'm using my redis as the docker container now there is no docker container now there is no docker container now there is no official version of official version of official version of redis for windows there is only a redis for windows there is only a redis for windows there is only a workaround workaround workaround so it's not recommended that you run so it's not recommended that you run so it's not recommended that you run even in pre-production even in pre-production even in pre-production environment when the red is on windows environment when the red is on windows environment when the red is on windows however many people do and if you want however many people do and if you want however many people do and if you want to do so just google for to do so just google for to do so just google for redis for windows and there's going to redis for windows and there's going to redis for windows and there's going to be an msi file that you can just be an msi file that you can just be an msi file that you can just just install and becomes one of the just install and becomes one of the just install and becomes one of the windows services windows services windows services in my case though i will be using it in in my case though i will be using it in in my case though i will be using it in docker and i will provide you with docker and i will provide you with docker and i will provide you with all the necessary docker compose files all the necessary docker compose files all the necessary docker compose files so you can restore this infrastructure so you can restore this infrastructure so you can restore this infrastructure on your own machine now that i have my on your own machine now that i have my on your own machine now that i have my installation directory unzipped installation directory unzipped installation directory unzipped i can take a look at what's inside we'll i can take a look at what's inside we'll i can take a look at what's inside we'll find a bunch of files bunch of find a bunch of files bunch of find a bunch of files bunch of directories directories directories and one of them is going to be identity and one of them is going to be identity and one of them is going to be identity service we will be installing later service we will be installing later service we will be installing later there is going to be a connection string there is going to be a connection string there is going to be a connection string file where we have to specify how to file where we have to specify how to file where we have to specify how to connect to the underlying databases connect to the underlying databases connect to the underlying databases and there is going to be idb folder the and there is going to be idb folder the and there is going to be idb folder the b folder here contains a backup b folder here contains a backup b folder here contains a backup to mssql in my case i'm installing a to mssql in my case i'm installing a to mssql in my case i'm installing a mess sql mess sql mess sql but the procedure for postgrad is very but the procedure for postgrad is very but the procedure for postgrad is very similar it's going to contain a backup similar it's going to contain a backup similar it's going to contain a backup file that we will use to restore file that we will use to restore file that we will use to restore the database the next thing we need to the database the next thing we need to the database the next thing we need to do is we need to actually use this do is we need to actually use this do is we need to actually use this directory and put it in a place where we directory and put it in a place where we directory and put it in a place where we can can can bring up a website so in order for me to bring up a website so in order for me to bring up a website so in order for me to do that do that do that i'm going to be using my iis now is i'm going to be using my iis now is i'm going to be using my iis now is what's going to what's going to what's going to run the application and currently i have run the application and currently i have run the application and currently i have some applications already installed here some applications already installed here some applications already installed here but i will have them turned off as you but i will have them turned off as you but i will have them turned off as you can tell that i have already some can tell that i have already some can tell that i have already some samples installed here samples installed here samples installed here but they are all deactivated but they are all deactivated but they are all deactivated now by default i prefer to install my now by default i prefer to install my now by default i prefer to install my applications in a particular space on applications in a particular space on applications in a particular space on the disk and that's going to be under the disk and that's going to be under the disk and that's going to be under in that pub www and then in that pub www and then in that pub www and then all my applications are going to end up all my applications are going to end up all my applications are going to end up here now the reason i choose to install here now the reason i choose to install here now the reason i choose to install it in this particular four it in this particular four it in this particular four folders because this folder by default folders because this folder by default folders because this folder by default is where iis is where iis is where iis wants to look for all the files and wants to look for all the files and wants to look for all the files and there aren't going to be any permissions there aren't going to be any permissions there aren't going to be any permissions issues issues issues now if you want to install it in some now if you want to install it in some now if you want to install it in some other directory you need to make sure other directory you need to make sure other directory you need to make sure that you give proper permissions for the that you give proper permissions for the that you give proper permissions for the iis user to execute iis user to execute iis user to execute against that directory you can do that against that directory you can do that against that directory you can do that quite easily so let's create quite easily so let's create quite easily so let's create a new directory creatio a new directory creatio a new directory creatio demo oops demo demo oops demo demo oops demo and if i want to install it let's say and if i want to install it let's say and if i want to install it let's say inside this directory and i want to inside this directory and i want to inside this directory and i want to point point point iis to work in this directory i need to iis to work in this directory i need to iis to work in this directory i need to make sure that the iis make sure that the iis make sure that the iis user has the necessary permissions i'll user has the necessary permissions i'll user has the necessary permissions i'll right click properties on the directory right click properties on the directory right click properties on the directory i'll go into my security and i'll make i'll go into my security and i'll make i'll go into my security and i'll make sure that the user sure that the user sure that the user is actually has permissions so let's go is actually has permissions so let's go is actually has permissions so let's go here under here under here under edit i believe and let's add a new user edit i believe and let's add a new user edit i believe and let's add a new user it's going to be ias is you it's going to be ias is you it's going to be ias is you i saw i believe let's check names i saw i believe let's check names i saw i believe let's check names hopefully it picks it up if it doesn't hopefully it picks it up if it doesn't hopefully it picks it up if it doesn't i you sr something like this no not in the domain in my machine no not in the domain in my machine and object type this is probably the hardest part i this is probably the hardest part i can't find them can't find them can't find them let's go on the advanced and in here we can start with searches and in here we can start with searches find now but what am i looking for find now but what am i looking for find now but what am i looking for let's start find now and i s let's start find now and i s let's start find now and i s here that's the one that i want so this here that's the one that i want so this here that's the one that i want so this is the user that i want to is the user that i want to is the user that i want to know again didn't get it right know again didn't get it right know again didn't get it right sorry let's do it again this is the one sorry let's do it again this is the one sorry let's do it again this is the one that i want that i want that i want is iusrs so just a weird name is iusrs so just a weird name is iusrs so just a weird name but you just have to make sure that you but you just have to make sure that you but you just have to make sure that you find this uh find this uh find this uh find this user okay so now that i've find this user okay so now that i've find this user okay so now that i've selected this user to have access to selected this user to have access to selected this user to have access to this directory i also want to make sure this directory i also want to make sure this directory i also want to make sure that i that i that i grant full control to this director grant full control to this director grant full control to this director otherwise otherwise otherwise the user that executes the thread will the user that executes the thread will the user that executes the thread will not be able to touch the files and not be able to touch the files and not be able to touch the files and modify them modify them modify them as the application requires to do so so as the application requires to do so so as the application requires to do so so make sure that you allow full control to make sure that you allow full control to make sure that you allow full control to this folder this folder this folder okay and now we can click apply and we okay and now we can click apply and we okay and now we can click apply and we can click can click can click on ok now in some machines where you do on ok now in some machines where you do on ok now in some machines where you do not have administrative access that not have administrative access that not have administrative access that would be a problematic issue would be a problematic issue would be a problematic issue so make sure that you talk to your so make sure that you talk to your so make sure that you talk to your system administrators and they allow you system administrators and they allow you system administrators and they allow you to great um that they allow you to great um that they allow you to connect to connect to connect to or execute something as the or execute something as the or execute something as the administrator just give me a second i'll administrator just give me a second i'll administrator just give me a second i'll try to try to try to relog into my machine relog into my machine relog into my machine all right so now we've applied all right so now we've applied all right so now we've applied permissions to permissions to permissions to this folder so after having reconnected this folder so after having reconnected this folder so after having reconnected now we've applied permissions to this now we've applied permissions to this now we've applied permissions to this folder and the next thing i want to do folder and the next thing i want to do folder and the next thing i want to do is i want to make sure that is i want to make sure that is i want to make sure that i copy the content of our zip folder i copy the content of our zip folder i copy the content of our zip folder inside this directory inside this directory inside this directory so let's go back into our previously so let's go back into our previously so let's go back into our previously extracted directory extracted directory extracted directory and just copy the whole thing and i'll and just copy the whole thing and i'll and just copy the whole thing and i'll use control x to use control x to use control x to cut and i'm going to paste it into this cut and i'm going to paste it into this cut and i'm going to paste it into this directory directory directory now after having pasted everything back now after having pasted everything back now after having pasted everything back into into into this drive the next thing that we're this drive the next thing that we're this drive the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to try to going to do is we're going to try to going to do is we're going to try to create create create with the help of iis we're going to try with the help of iis we're going to try with the help of iis we're going to try to create a website and the application to create a website and the application to create a website and the application pool let's open our is manager and let's open our is manager and in here i have some sites and some in here i have some sites and some in here i have some sites and some application pools but they're all application pools but they're all application pools but they're all stopped as you could tell so let's stopped as you could tell so let's stopped as you could tell so let's create a new one we'll add a website create a new one we'll add a website create a new one we'll add a website let's give it a name so i'm going to let's give it a name so i'm going to let's give it a name so i'm going to call it stu call it stu call it stu creatio studio creatio studio creatio studio and let's give it a path to the folder and let's give it a path to the folder and let's give it a path to the folder that we have that we have that we have extracted our director our product in extracted our director our product in extracted our director our product in so creation demo now we can specify so creation demo now we can specify so creation demo now we can specify we have to specify a port i'm going to we have to specify a port i'm going to we have to specify a port i'm going to i'm going to pick 7010 i'm going to pick 7010 i'm going to pick 7010 any port will do 82 85 80 whatever the any port will do 82 85 80 whatever the any port will do 82 85 80 whatever the case might be case might be case might be just make sure that this port is not just make sure that this port is not just make sure that this port is not occupied by anything else occupied by anything else occupied by anything else the host name i'm going to specify is my the host name i'm going to specify is my the host name i'm going to specify is my own local host name own local host name own local host name this is the name of my machine if you this is the name of my machine if you this is the name of my machine if you want to find out what your want to find out what your want to find out what your machine name is just open your console machine name is just open your console machine name is just open your console and type in host and type in host and type in host name as one word and you will know what name as one word and you will know what name as one word and you will know what your host name is your host name is your host name is now the only reason i'm doing it is just now the only reason i'm doing it is just now the only reason i'm doing it is just because i'm addressing this machine from because i'm addressing this machine from because i'm addressing this machine from other applications by this other applications by this other applications by this host name so it makes sense uh host name so it makes sense uh host name so it makes sense uh for me to make sure that my ies site is for me to make sure that my ies site is for me to make sure that my ies site is going to be responsive going to be responsive going to be responsive when i'm addressing this way okay so when i'm addressing this way okay so when i'm addressing this way okay so let's save this let's save this let's save this and now let's open the website right and now let's open the website right and now let's open the website right click on it and say add application click on it and say add application click on it and say add application give it an alias of zero and specify give it an alias of zero and specify give it an alias of zero and specify physical path physical path physical path to the same folder but inside that to the same folder but inside that to the same folder but inside that folder there is another folder called folder there is another folder called folder there is another folder called chairsoft web app so let's just make chairsoft web app so let's just make chairsoft web app so let's just make sure that we sure that we sure that we select airsoft web app at this point select airsoft web app at this point select airsoft web app at this point good good good as soon as you add this application a as soon as you add this application a as soon as you add this application a new application pool will be created in new application pool will be created in new application pool will be created in iis iis iis if it doesn't get created you can go and if it doesn't get created you can go and if it doesn't get created you can go and manually add it manually add it manually add it by hand so all you can do is you can say by hand so all you can do is you can say by hand so all you can do is you can say add application pool add application pool add application pool give it a name so let's say test pool give it a name so let's say test pool give it a name so let's say test pool make sure that it's a clr make sure that it's a clr make sure that it's a clr integrated start immediately here's my integrated start immediately here's my integrated start immediately here's my test app pool test app pool test app pool and if i wanted to add an application and if i wanted to add an application and if i wanted to add an application pool so for example i'm going to add pool so for example i'm going to add pool so for example i'm going to add an application when i'm creating it here an application when i'm creating it here an application when i'm creating it here i can select the application that i uh i i can select the application that i uh i i can select the application that i uh i can use any pool that i have previously can use any pool that i have previously can use any pool that i have previously selected selected selected so you can go ahead and create the pool so you can go ahead and create the pool so you can go ahead and create the pool first and then first and then first and then add the application or you can just add the application or you can just add the application or you can just simply add the application and the pool simply add the application and the pool simply add the application and the pool will be created will be created will be created now if the pool doesn't get created in now if the pool doesn't get created in now if the pool doesn't get created in the right way then just make sure that the right way then just make sure that the right way then just make sure that you you you override it by hand okay so now we've override it by hand okay so now we've override it by hand okay so now we've got the application pool and we've got got the application pool and we've got got the application pool and we've got the website configured and if you try the website configured and if you try the website configured and if you try navigating to this port 7010 navigating to this port 7010 navigating to this port 7010 then you're going to get an error we then you're going to get an error we then you're going to get an error we have not specified a connection string have not specified a connection string have not specified a connection string to our redis database to our redis database to our redis database we have not specified a string to our we have not specified a string to our we have not specified a string to our data database server data database server data database server and this is what we're going to do next and this is what we're going to do next and this is what we're going to do next so the website at this point is not so the website at this point is not so the website at this point is not working at all working at all working at all all right if we want to follow the all right if we want to follow the all right if we want to follow the instructions instructions instructions uh we can take a look how we can uh we can take a look how we can uh we can take a look how we can install redis and how we can install the install redis and how we can install the install redis and how we can install the database database database but in my particular case what i'm going but in my particular case what i'm going but in my particular case what i'm going to do is i'm going to just simply start to do is i'm going to just simply start to do is i'm going to just simply start my iis my iis my iis so my uh not my is my sql so so my uh not my is my sql so so my uh not my is my sql so i have um i have um i have um i have sql installed already i'm not i have sql installed already i'm not i have sql installed already i'm not going to go through the installation going to go through the installation going to go through the installation uh just follow uh standard uh just follow uh standard uh just follow uh standard sql express installation tutorials sql express installation tutorials sql express installation tutorials online online online and you will be able to figure out how and you will be able to figure out how and you will be able to figure out how to do that to do that to do that in my case the service is not started so in my case the service is not started so in my case the service is not started so i'm going to go and start i'm going to go and start i'm going to go and start you don't need to do that if you if you you don't need to do that if you if you you don't need to do that if you if you never shut it down so if you just simply never shut it down so if you just simply never shut it down so if you just simply installed it installed it installed it then you don't need to do anything i'm then you don't need to do anything i'm then you don't need to do anything i'm also going to start the agent as well also going to start the agent as well also going to start the agent as well so just come here and click start okay perfect so now everything is up and okay perfect so now everything is up and running running running and the next thing that we need to do is and the next thing that we need to do is and the next thing that we need to do is we need to log on to our sql server we need to log on to our sql server we need to log on to our sql server make sure that we note the connection make sure that we note the connection make sure that we note the connection string and then we're going to have to string and then we're going to have to string and then we're going to have to go go go and adjust this connection string all and adjust this connection string all and adjust this connection string all right right right for that i'm going to use sql studio but for that i'm going to use sql studio but for that i'm going to use sql studio but before you do a sql studio let me point before you do a sql studio let me point before you do a sql studio let me point out to couple of uh out to couple of uh out to couple of uh common mistakes or common common mistakes or common common mistakes or common issues that people might be having so issues that people might be having so issues that people might be having so let's go into let's go into let's go into sql server i believe it's called sql server i believe it's called sql server i believe it's called uh i think that's the installation uh i think that's the installation uh i think that's the installation center or center or center or import export data i'm sorry import export data i'm sorry import export data i'm sorry uh sql server uh sql server uh sql server uh where's this management studio uh where's this management studio uh where's this management studio profiler profiler profiler error uh you know what let's just skip it for uh you know what let's just skip it for now let's go let's go straight into now let's go let's go straight into now let's go let's go straight into studio studio studio studio studio studio inside sql studio we'll use this product inside sql studio we'll use this product inside sql studio we'll use this product to restore the database and to restore the database and to restore the database and feed the feed the drive feed the file feed the feed the drive feed the file feed the feed the drive feed the file that's located here in db folder that's located here in db folder that's located here in db folder so this is what we're going to be so this is what we're going to be so this is what we're going to be restoring right now restoring right now restoring right now let me connect to my instance i'm let me connect to my instance i'm let me connect to my instance i'm connecting as the administrator connecting as the administrator connecting as the administrator with the help of and uh with the help of with the help of and uh with the help of with the help of and uh with the help of nt authentication nt authentication nt authentication but you need to make sure off on your but you need to make sure off on your but you need to make sure off on your sql express and this is probably the sql express and this is probably the sql express and this is probably the easiest easiest easiest configuration is to go right click on configuration is to go right click on configuration is to go right click on the name of your server the name of your server the name of your server click properties and in security make click properties and in security make click properties and in security make sure that you allow sure that you allow sure that you allow sql server authentication mode now you sql server authentication mode now you sql server authentication mode now you can can can use it with windows authentication mode use it with windows authentication mode use it with windows authentication mode in my particular case i'm using sql in my particular case i'm using sql in my particular case i'm using sql server authentication mode rather than server authentication mode rather than server authentication mode rather than windows so i can specify the username windows so i can specify the username windows so i can specify the username and password and password and password directly in my connection string when directly in my connection string when directly in my connection string when i'm using it for i'm using it for i'm using it for when i'm using it with with my product when i'm using it with with my product when i'm using it with with my product okay let's go in the database and i have okay let's go in the database and i have okay let's go in the database and i have i believe one database here already i believe one database here already i believe one database here already installed so let's just simply right installed so let's just simply right installed so let's just simply right click click click on the databases and say restore on the databases and say restore on the databases and say restore database so here's the database so here's the database so here's the option restore database and we're going option restore database and we're going option restore database and we're going to specify device to specify device to specify device from which we're restoring and device from which we're restoring and device from which we're restoring and device happens to be just a physical location happens to be just a physical location happens to be just a physical location so we're going to go back on our c drive so we're going to go back on our c drive so we're going to go back on our c drive find creation demo find creation demo find creation demo find db folder select it and here's my find db folder select it and here's my find db folder select it and here's my backup file backup file backup file and let's click ok now the studio and let's click ok now the studio and let's click ok now the studio database that's a default name that's database that's a default name that's database that's a default name that's going to be going to be going to be given by the creators of this backup you given by the creators of this backup you given by the creators of this backup you can rename it at any can rename it at any can rename it at any you can rename it at this point and why you can rename it at this point and why you can rename it at this point and why don't we just take a look what we call don't we just take a look what we call don't we just take a look what we call their website in is their website in is their website in is we called it creatio studio we called it creatio studio we called it creatio studio and let's go ahead and call this thing and let's go ahead and call this thing and let's go ahead and call this thing as well creation as well creation as well creation studio now it's going to perform a full studio now it's going to perform a full studio now it's going to perform a full backup it's telling you the version backup it's telling you the version backup it's telling you the version of the backup and just simply click ok the backup doesn't take too long and in the backup doesn't take too long and in later later later uh parts of the tutorial i'll show you uh parts of the tutorial i'll show you uh parts of the tutorial i'll show you how to restore it with the help of how to restore it with the help of how to restore it with the help of powershell so you don't have to do it by powershell so you don't have to do it by powershell so you don't have to do it by hand hand hand okay so now that we've restored the okay so now that we've restored the okay so now that we've restored the database we also need to make sure that database we also need to make sure that database we also need to make sure that we have a user who can connect to this we have a user who can connect to this we have a user who can connect to this database database database now to create a user you can go into now to create a user you can go into now to create a user you can go into security and to security and to security and to logins and just simply right click on logins and just simply right click on logins and just simply right click on the login create new login the login create new login the login create new login come up with the name make sure it's a come up with the name make sure it's a come up with the name make sure it's a sql authentication sql authentication sql authentication provide the name username and password provide the name username and password provide the name username and password make sure that you uncheck enforce make sure that you uncheck enforce make sure that you uncheck enforce policy security so you can provide some policy security so you can provide some policy security so you can provide some simple passwords such as one one one simple passwords such as one one one simple passwords such as one one one since it's just a development machine since it's just a development machine since it's just a development machine we don't want any any issues with the we don't want any any issues with the we don't want any any issues with the security here security here security here so i've done that already and i've so i've done that already and i've so i've done that already and i've created myself two usernames one is created myself two usernames one is created myself two usernames one is called creation one is called supervisor called creation one is called supervisor called creation one is called supervisor for no good reason it just the name that for no good reason it just the name that for no good reason it just the name that i've decided to give i've decided to give i've decided to give it let's now go back into our database it let's now go back into our database it let's now go back into our database the one that we just restored and what the one that we just restored and what the one that we just restored and what we can do is we can either right click we can do is we can either right click we can do is we can either right click on the database here go into properties on the database here go into properties on the database here go into properties and we can specify permissions okay and and we can specify permissions okay and and we can specify permissions okay and create user mappings this way create user mappings this way create user mappings this way but what i find the easiest is just to but what i find the easiest is just to but what i find the easiest is just to simply go to a login right click on the simply go to a login right click on the simply go to a login right click on the login go to properties login go to properties login go to properties and from the properties you go to user and from the properties you go to user and from the properties you go to user mappings mappings mappings okay choose the user mapping that you okay choose the user mapping that you okay choose the user mapping that you would like to use in this case you can would like to use in this case you can would like to use in this case you can say creatio studio say creatio studio say creatio studio and make sure that you give it a role of and make sure that you give it a role of and make sure that you give it a role of db owner now we can do the same thing for say now we can do the same thing for say another user if you want to have more another user if you want to have more another user if you want to have more than one user connecting to this than one user connecting to this than one user connecting to this database database database so all we have to do is use our mapping so all we have to do is use our mapping so all we have to do is use our mapping and where's my creation studio and let's and where's my creation studio and let's and where's my creation studio and let's just give it a db owner just give it a db owner just give it a db owner perfect so now we have a user we can perfect so now we have a user we can perfect so now we have a user we can try logging on so to make sure that i try logging on so to make sure that i try logging on so to make sure that i can can can actually connect what i'm going to do is actually connect what i'm going to do is actually connect what i'm going to do is i'm going to disconnect now and i'm i'm going to disconnect now and i'm i'm going to disconnect now and i'm going to try to reconnect going to try to reconnect going to try to reconnect and instead of using windows and instead of using windows and instead of using windows authentication i'm going to try to use authentication i'm going to try to use authentication i'm going to try to use sql authentication sql authentication sql authentication and i think the password is supervisor let me connect supervisor let me connect and i can see that i can connect and i and i can see that i can connect and i and i can see that i can connect and i have access to creation studio have access to creation studio have access to creation studio i can perform queries uh so let's make sure we use creation uh so let's make sure we use creation studio and let's studio and let's studio and let's select i don't know id from contact select i don't know id from contact select i don't know id from contact and if i execute the query you could and if i execute the query you could and if i execute the query you could tell that i'm getting some records back tell that i'm getting some records back tell that i'm getting some records back perfect so i've got my database working perfect so i've got my database working perfect so i've got my database working it's now time for me to it's now time for me to it's now time for me to configure my connection strings now configure my connection strings now configure my connection strings now what i'm going to do is i'm going to what i'm going to do is i'm going to what i'm going to do is i'm going to actually copy this actually copy this actually copy this copy this uh database name for copy this uh database name for copy this uh database name for later use but now let's go ahead and later use but now let's go ahead and later use but now let's go ahead and configure it so configure it so configure it so in our i think this is us right no this is us i think this is us right no this is us on this disk uh directory there is a on this disk uh directory there is a on this disk uh directory there is a file called connection string file called connection string file called connection string let's find it here's a connection string let's find it here's a connection string let's find it here's a connection string and i'll open it with my favorite text and i'll open it with my favorite text and i'll open it with my favorite text editor editor editor so here's my connection string and i so here's my connection string and i so here's my connection string and i have an example of a connection string have an example of a connection string have an example of a connection string that i was using in the past this is that i was using in the past this is that i was using in the past this is what it's going to look like what it's going to look like what it's going to look like when you open it on your screen and when you open it on your screen and when you open it on your screen and we're going to have to modify a couple we're going to have to modify a couple we're going to have to modify a couple of lines here of lines here of lines here the first line that you want to modify the first line that you want to modify the first line that you want to modify is this this is the line that's is this this is the line that's is this this is the line that's responsible for specifying where your responsible for specifying where your responsible for specifying where your redis lives redis lives redis lives now in my case my redis lives on my now in my case my redis lives on my now in my case my redis lives on my local host so i can just simply say local host so i can just simply say local host so i can just simply say localhost or local host localhost or local host localhost or local host i have to assign a database by default i have to assign a database by default i have to assign a database by default redis when installed in docker or as a redis when installed in docker or as a redis when installed in docker or as a windows service has 16 databases with windows service has 16 databases with windows service has 16 databases with the the the xero based index so 0 is the first xero based index so 0 is the first xero based index so 0 is the first database and 15 is the last one database and 15 is the last one database and 15 is the last one so we're going to give it let's say so we're going to give it let's say so we're going to give it let's say database 15 as i i'm pretty sure i'm not database 15 as i i'm pretty sure i'm not database 15 as i i'm pretty sure i'm not using it for anything using it for anything using it for anything at the moment on my machine 6379 is a at the moment on my machine 6379 is a at the moment on my machine 6379 is a default port for redis so if you haven't default port for redis so if you haven't default port for redis so if you haven't configured anything configured anything configured anything differently then 6379 is going to be the differently then 6379 is going to be the differently then 6379 is going to be the port that port that port that radius will listen on the next thing for radius will listen on the next thing for radius will listen on the next thing for us to configure us to configure us to configure is this line and this line is our is this line and this line is our is this line and this line is our database connection let me just copy database connection let me just copy database connection let me just copy this database connection string this database connection string this database connection string you can build your own but i'm since you can build your own but i'm since you can build your own but i'm since i've already pre-built it i've already pre-built it i've already pre-built it i'm just simply going to copy it here i'm just simply going to copy it here i'm just simply going to copy it here and we're going to tweak it a little bit and we're going to tweak it a little bit and we're going to tweak it a little bit so in this case i'm specifying a data so in this case i'm specifying a data so in this case i'm specifying a data source for source for source for my instance of sql and i can easily get my instance of sql and i can easily get my instance of sql and i can easily get it if i look it if i look it if i look at my sql management studio i at my sql management studio i at my sql management studio i you can tell what this is it's going to you can tell what this is it's going to you can tell what this is it's going to say say say your connection string here not your connection string here not your connection string here not connection string that the instance of connection string that the instance of connection string that the instance of the server the server the server you can also simply disconnect from it you can also simply disconnect from it you can also simply disconnect from it and try to reconnect and try to reconnect and try to reconnect and here is your connection string and here is your connection string and here is your connection string another connection string but the another connection string but the another connection string but the server name the initial catalog refers server name the initial catalog refers server name the initial catalog refers to the database name to the database name to the database name so if we're going to go back here as a so if we're going to go back here as a so if we're going to go back here as a um let me just log in um let me just log in um let me just log in and the database that we would like to and the database that we would like to and the database that we would like to target is this so target is this so target is this so select this database press f2 and just select this database press f2 and just select this database press f2 and just simply simply simply copy the name of the database so that's copy the name of the database so that's copy the name of the database so that's going to be going to be going to be my database name now the user id in my database name now the user id in my database name now the user id in mind the space between the user and id mind the space between the user and id mind the space between the user and id this is the right spelling this is the right spelling this is the right spelling is going to say creation this is the is going to say creation this is the is going to say creation this is the user who's going to be accessing user who's going to be accessing user who's going to be accessing our database or essentially this is our database or essentially this is our database or essentially this is going to be the user that the going to be the user that the going to be the user that the application pool is using to access the application pool is using to access the application pool is using to access the database database database we're then specifying the password and we're then specifying the password and we're then specifying the password and this is the reason that i wanted to use this is the reason that i wanted to use this is the reason that i wanted to use sql authentication so i can specify it sql authentication so i can specify it sql authentication so i can specify it very vividly very vividly very vividly right here in my connection string and right here in my connection string and right here in my connection string and then couple of other properties how to then couple of other properties how to then couple of other properties how to manage the connection manage the connection manage the connection this is all we have to do in order for this is all we have to do in order for this is all we have to do in order for us to start with the application us to start with the application us to start with the application so let's make sure we save this and we so let's make sure we save this and we so let's make sure we save this and we can now can now can now roll down our studio the next thing that roll down our studio the next thing that roll down our studio the next thing that i want to do is i want to simply check i want to do is i want to simply check i want to do is i want to simply check if my application is running now we can if my application is running now we can if my application is running now we can specify additional properties and specify additional properties and specify additional properties and additional settings and configure them additional settings and configure them additional settings and configure them but that's something that we're going to but that's something that we're going to but that's something that we're going to do with the help of a batch file that do with the help of a batch file that do with the help of a batch file that i've prepared for us that will do all i've prepared for us that will do all i've prepared for us that will do all this work for us automatically this work for us automatically this work for us automatically let's make sure that we can navigate to let's make sure that we can navigate to let's make sure that we can navigate to 7010 and that the application actually 7010 and that the application actually 7010 and that the application actually starts starts starts in some cases this application may not in some cases this application may not in some cases this application may not start and will give you some errors start and will give you some errors start and will give you some errors so in this case system argument so in this case system argument so in this case system argument exception parameter host cannot be exception parameter host cannot be exception parameter host cannot be empty string now it's too bad it's not empty string now it's too bad it's not empty string now it's too bad it's not telling us where but telling us where but telling us where but we simply need to go and configure um we simply need to go and configure um we simply need to go and configure um go and find where we did not configure go and find where we did not configure go and find where we did not configure this so maybe it's in our this so maybe it's in our this so maybe it's in our connection string so let's just simply connection string so let's just simply connection string so let's just simply find find find the connection string and host has to be the connection string and host has to be the connection string and host has to be i believe i believe i believe this way so i i believe i missed the this way so i i believe i missed the this way so i i believe i missed the word host this is the proper spelling word host this is the proper spelling word host this is the proper spelling and i forgot it so if you make a mistake and i forgot it so if you make a mistake and i forgot it so if you make a mistake you will get an error here you will get an error here you will get an error here this way this kind of error message and this way this kind of error message and this way this kind of error message and just make sure that you just make sure that you just make sure that you uh you can debug it you will also get uh you can debug it you will also get uh you can debug it you will also get some ideas or some hints some ideas or some hints some ideas or some hints into what's not working in this into what's not working in this into what's not working in this particular pic in this particular case particular pic in this particular case particular pic in this particular case you could clearly see that you could clearly see that you could clearly see that there's a lot of mention of redis so you there's a lot of mention of redis so you there's a lot of mention of redis so you know that something is going on with know that something is going on with know that something is going on with redis redis redis let's just try to f5 on this page and let's just try to f5 on this page and let's just try to f5 on this page and reload it reload it reload it if everything goes correctly i should if everything goes correctly i should if everything goes correctly i should see a login page which is what i expect see a login page which is what i expect see a login page which is what i expect at this point at this point at this point also mind you that you get some also mind you that you get some also mind you that you get some redirects here okay and at this point we redirects here okay and at this point we redirects here okay and at this point we can try to log in with the super can try to log in with the super can try to log in with the super supervisor supervisor supervisor supervisor supervisor supervisor now another reason that i've created now another reason that i've created now another reason that i've created this creation supervisor username and this creation supervisor username and this creation supervisor username and password here is that password here is that password here is that what the database credentials are in what the database credentials are in what the database credentials are in here for this database here for this database here for this database they have nothing to do with what your they have nothing to do with what your they have nothing to do with what your username and password will be here username and password will be here username and password will be here and the reason they have nothing to do and the reason they have nothing to do and the reason they have nothing to do here is because here is because here is because this is how you're accessing the this is how you're accessing the this is how you're accessing the database database database and supervisor supervisor is how you're and supervisor supervisor is how you're and supervisor supervisor is how you're actually accessing the application actually accessing the application actually accessing the application the first time we start the application the first time we start the application the first time we start the application it might take us a little while it might take us a little while it might take us a little while to load the application but then to load the application but then to load the application but then essentially everything essentially everything essentially everything works just fine now once your works just fine now once your works just fine now once your application is loaded for the first time application is loaded for the first time application is loaded for the first time you can try you can try you can try navigating from place to place you can navigating from place to place you can navigating from place to place you can go to different sections just to make go to different sections just to make go to different sections just to make sure sure sure everything works fine the best test and everything works fine the best test and everything works fine the best test and the best the best the best the best advice that i can give you is the best advice that i can give you is the best advice that i can give you is to just go into a cog wheel here to just go into a cog wheel here to just go into a cog wheel here scroll all the way down go to your scroll all the way down go to your scroll all the way down go to your advanced settings another by the way advanced settings another by the way advanced settings another by the way shortcut in the advanced settings if you shortcut in the advanced settings if you shortcut in the advanced settings if you open the new tab open the new tab open the new tab and if you go to slash zero slash dev it and if you go to slash zero slash dev it and if you go to slash zero slash dev it will also take you in the back end will also take you in the back end will also take you in the back end now when you're here in the back end the now when you're here in the back end the now when you're here in the back end the thing that you want to check is to make thing that you want to check is to make thing that you want to check is to make sure that everything compiles sure that everything compiles sure that everything compiles you usually do it only for the first you usually do it only for the first you usually do it only for the first time on the machine that you're time on the machine that you're time on the machine that you're installing the application for the first installing the application for the first installing the application for the first time so if it's your server time so if it's your server time so if it's your server and it's the first time you're and it's the first time you're and it's the first time you're installing application for the first installing application for the first installing application for the first time you want to make sure that the time you want to make sure that the time you want to make sure that the dependencies are addressed dependencies are addressed dependencies are addressed to make sure that everything is to make sure that everything is to make sure that everything is installed just simply click on compile installed just simply click on compile installed just simply click on compile if you're missing some components the if you're missing some components the if you're missing some components the compilation will let you know compilation will let you know compilation will let you know immediately immediately immediately or it will let you know immediately or it will let you know immediately or it will let you know immediately after it fails to compile after it fails to compile after it fails to compile so it one way or the other if your so it one way or the other if your so it one way or the other if your compilation is successful compilation is successful compilation is successful then you know everything is installed then you know everything is installed then you know everything is installed correctly now this is not the first time correctly now this is not the first time correctly now this is not the first time that i'm installing a that i'm installing a that i'm installing a instance of creation on this machine so instance of creation on this machine so instance of creation on this machine so i'm pretty confident that things will go i'm pretty confident that things will go i'm pretty confident that things will go as planned now after this as planned now after this as planned now after this compilation is completed you can see you compilation is completed you can see you compilation is completed you can see you can you can then can you can then can you can then go ahead and convert it to development go ahead and convert it to development go ahead and convert it to development and file system mode or do whatever it and file system mode or do whatever it and file system mode or do whatever it is that you want to do is that you want to do is that you want to do and in my case you could tell that the and in my case you could tell that the and in my case you could tell that the operation was successful so i now know operation was successful so i now know operation was successful so i now know that everything that i did is correctly that everything that i did is correctly that everything that i did is correctly installed installed installed the next couple of things that we want the next couple of things that we want the next couple of things that we want to do is we want to probably configure to do is we want to probably configure to do is we want to probably configure it to operate it to operate it to operate with the to work with the exchange with the to work with the exchange with the to work with the exchange listener listener listener to maybe install uh identity service and to maybe install uh identity service and to maybe install uh identity service and things of that nature things of that nature things of that nature now previous episodes demonstrated how now previous episodes demonstrated how now previous episodes demonstrated how to configure to configure to configure exchange listeners so i'm not going to exchange listeners so i'm not going to exchange listeners so i'm not going to spend time on that but what i will spend spend time on that but what i will spend spend time on that but what i will spend time on a little bit right now time on a little bit right now time on a little bit right now is to show you how and walk you through is to show you how and walk you through is to show you how and walk you through a powershell script that will help you a powershell script that will help you a powershell script that will help you configure the application in a similar configure the application in a similar configure the application in a similar fashion fashion fashion so let me close this down let me close so let me close this down let me close so let me close this down let me close this this this on this thing down okay let me close all on this thing down okay let me close all on this thing down okay let me close all this stuff down this stuff down this stuff down and what i'm going to do is i'm going to and what i'm going to do is i'm going to and what i'm going to do is i'm going to stop uh all these stop uh all these stop uh all these applications i don't want it to consume applications i don't want it to consume applications i don't want it to consume any any ram right now any any ram right now any any ram right now so i'm going to stop them all so i'm going to stop them all so i'm going to stop them all my test pool i can stop and everything my test pool i can stop and everything my test pool i can stop and everything should stop now in creation studio let should stop now in creation studio let should stop now in creation studio let me stop this one as well me stop this one as well me stop this one as well okay perfect okay perfect okay perfect let me now find i believe i have a directory here and my builds i have a directory here and my builds and in my install scripts and in my install scripts and in my install scripts uh install creation now that's not the uh install creation now that's not the uh install creation now that's not the right one right one right one just give me a second i'm looking for it just give me a second i'm looking for it just give me a second i'm looking for it maybe it's maybe it's maybe it's in this episode that i copied it in this episode that i copied it in this episode that i copied it uh postgrad database install creatio no that's not the one uh no that's not the one uh one second install creation one second install creation one second install creation let me see if this is the one right so what we're trying to do here right so what we're trying to do here is we're trying to create an application is we're trying to create an application is we're trying to create an application pool pool pool or we're trying to create essentially a or we're trying to create essentially a or we're trying to create essentially a powershell powershell powershell script that helps us with the database script that helps us with the database script that helps us with the database so before we we did quite a lot of steps so before we we did quite a lot of steps so before we we did quite a lot of steps manually here manually here manually here and what we're going to try to do now is and what we're going to try to do now is and what we're going to try to do now is we're going to try to we're going to try to we're going to try to build the same thing but now with the build the same thing but now with the build the same thing but now with the help of the help of the help of the with the help of powershell script now with the help of powershell script now with the help of powershell script now let's uh let's uh let's uh explore some of the infrastructure that explore some of the infrastructure that explore some of the infrastructure that i kind of alluded to before but i i kind of alluded to before but i i kind of alluded to before but i haven't really shown it to you haven't really shown it to you haven't really shown it to you so in my docker i have a couple of so in my docker i have a couple of so in my docker i have a couple of containers running so as soon as it containers running so as soon as it containers running so as soon as it starts starts starts you'll see that i have exchange sync you'll see that i have exchange sync you'll see that i have exchange sync running this is the exchange listener running this is the exchange listener running this is the exchange listener container container container i got a redis running and i got a i got a redis running and i got a i got a redis running and i got a postgrad database running here postgrad database running here postgrad database running here as well now the postgrad database as well now the postgrad database as well now the postgrad database contains contains contains two containers actually one is just the two containers actually one is just the two containers actually one is just the actual postgrad database itself so actual postgrad database itself so actual postgrad database itself so that's the thing that that's the thing that that's the thing that stores the data and allows for stores the data and allows for stores the data and allows for persistent data storage persistent data storage persistent data storage but then i'm also running a separate but then i'm also running a separate but then i'm also running a separate container for pg admin and the pg admin container for pg admin and the pg admin container for pg admin and the pg admin is the container that allows me to is the container that allows me to is the container that allows me to manage my manage my manage my postgrad database with the gui rather postgrad database with the gui rather postgrad database with the gui rather than with the command mode than with the command mode than with the command mode now you can tell that i've exposed port now you can tell that i've exposed port now you can tell that i've exposed port 8080 for 8080 for 8080 for pg admin i've exposed port 5432 pg admin i've exposed port 5432 pg admin i've exposed port 5432 for my database i've done the same thing for my database i've done the same thing for my database i've done the same thing for my redis and i exposed port 6379 for my redis and i exposed port 6379 for my redis and i exposed port 6379 and this is why i can connect from and this is why i can connect from and this is why i can connect from creation running in windows creation running in windows creation running in windows to redis running in a subsystem for to redis running in a subsystem for to redis running in a subsystem for linux on windows this is this is how i'm linux on windows this is this is how i'm linux on windows this is this is how i'm running my redis running my redis running my redis so if i simply navigate now to localhost so if i simply navigate now to localhost so if i simply navigate now to localhost port 8080 port 8080 port 8080 and let's try making make sure that it's and let's try making make sure that it's and let's try making make sure that it's actually work i will be greeted by my postgrad now i will be greeted by my postgrad now i've configured my username and password i've configured my username and password i've configured my username and password already so already so already so as soon as i connect i should be able oh as soon as i connect i should be able oh as soon as i connect i should be able oh there's an update great there's an update great there's an update great as soon as i connect i should be able to as soon as i connect i should be able to as soon as i connect i should be able to see my server and all my databases and see my server and all my databases and see my server and all my databases and whatever else i have here now with the whatever else i have here now with the whatever else i have here now with the help of this tool just like we did with help of this tool just like we did with help of this tool just like we did with the help of the help of the help of sql from window from microsoft sql from window from microsoft sql from window from microsoft with the help of postgrad we can also with the help of postgrad we can also with the help of postgrad we can also restore the database in exactly the same restore the database in exactly the same restore the database in exactly the same way way way if we want to go to database we can say if we want to go to database we can say if we want to go to database we can say create and once the database is created create and once the database is created create and once the database is created we can we can we can essentially come back here and we can essentially come back here and we can essentially come back here and we can restore the database so the process is restore the database so the process is restore the database so the process is exactly exactly exactly the same but rather than using uh the same but rather than using uh the same but rather than using uh this gui what i would rather do is i this gui what i would rather do is i this gui what i would rather do is i would rather not touch the gui at all would rather not touch the gui at all would rather not touch the gui at all and i want to make sure that i can and i want to make sure that i can and i want to make sure that i can install everything install everything install everything with the help of my um with the help of with the help of my um with the help of with the help of my um with the help of my my my uh powershell so let me open uh uh powershell so let me open uh uh powershell so let me open uh visual studio and let me open this visual studio and let me open this visual studio and let me open this directory and i believe directory and i believe directory and i believe this is not the right place so let me this is not the right place so let me this is not the right place so let me just open this guy just open this guy just open this guy all right so all right so all right so what we're seeing here um yeah i think what we're seeing here um yeah i think what we're seeing here um yeah i think this is the right place this is the right place this is the right place uh and i will share all these scripts uh and i will share all these scripts uh and i will share all these scripts for you so what we're seeing here is for you so what we're seeing here is for you so what we're seeing here is inside this file we're gonna start inside this file we're gonna start inside this file we're gonna start installing the application installing the application installing the application now the partial script starts off with now the partial script starts off with now the partial script starts off with the couple of parameters it's asking for the couple of parameters it's asking for the couple of parameters it's asking for at the at the at the input so it says that i need to know the input so it says that i need to know the input so it says that i need to know the app name and i need to know the app name and i need to know the app name and i need to know the folder name some db user and the db folder name some db user and the db folder name some db user and the db password password password some ports and basically a bunch of some ports and basically a bunch of some ports and basically a bunch of other configurations that other configurations that other configurations that are necessary for me to install the are necessary for me to install the are necessary for me to install the application application application then we're gonna go and we're gonna then we're gonna go and we're gonna then we're gonna go and we're gonna start with the various installation start with the various installation start with the various installation steps so step one we need to make sure steps so step one we need to make sure steps so step one we need to make sure that we create the directory that we create the directory that we create the directory i'm taking simply the app name and i'm i'm taking simply the app name and i'm i'm taking simply the app name and i'm saying i'm gonna create this directory saying i'm gonna create this directory saying i'm gonna create this directory and i'm going to copy and i'm going to copy and i'm going to copy everything into that directory everything into that directory everything into that directory i'm then going to restore my powershell i'm then going to restore my powershell i'm then going to restore my powershell restore my restore my restore my database with the help of postgresql and database with the help of postgresql and database with the help of postgresql and here's how i'm restoring it so here's here's how i'm restoring it so here's here's how i'm restoring it so here's two steps to restore the database two steps to restore the database two steps to restore the database first we execute command in docker to first we execute command in docker to first we execute command in docker to make sure that we create the database make sure that we create the database make sure that we create the database and then we execute the command that we and then we execute the command that we and then we execute the command that we actually restore the database actually restore the database actually restore the database and i can go ahead and delete the and i can go ahead and delete the and i can go ahead and delete the database folder if i wanted to database folder if i wanted to database folder if i wanted to and then i can start configuring my and then i can start configuring my and then i can start configuring my connection string and here i'm parsing connection string and here i'm parsing connection string and here i'm parsing my connection string my connection string my connection string file i'm looking for the redis file i'm looking for the redis file i'm looking for the redis name and i'm just simply giving it a name and i'm just simply giving it a name and i'm just simply giving it a localhost radius localhost radius localhost radius a db number which i'm taking as a a db number which i'm taking as a a db number which i'm taking as a parameter into the script and i'm parameter into the script and i'm parameter into the script and i'm specifying the port specifying the port specifying the port i'm doing exactly the same thing to i'm doing exactly the same thing to i'm doing exactly the same thing to address the connection to the database address the connection to the database address the connection to the database and at this point my database is and at this point my database is and at this point my database is restored now in microsoft sql restoring restored now in microsoft sql restoring restored now in microsoft sql restoring the databases the databases the databases you saw takes no time at all maybe a you saw takes no time at all maybe a you saw takes no time at all maybe a second maybe two second maybe two second maybe two on postgre it takes quite a bit of time on postgre it takes quite a bit of time on postgre it takes quite a bit of time in my case it takes up to four minutes in my case it takes up to four minutes in my case it takes up to four minutes to restore database so if you're sitting to restore database so if you're sitting to restore database so if you're sitting there and you're thinking that nothing there and you're thinking that nothing there and you're thinking that nothing is happening is happening is happening things are happening it just it just things are happening it just it just things are happening it just it just takes significantly longer takes significantly longer takes significantly longer the next step for us is to create iis the next step for us is to create iis the next step for us is to create iis this this this uh or create the website and create the uh or create the website and create the uh or create the website and create the application pool application pool application pool these steps are exactly the same for ms these steps are exactly the same for ms these steps are exactly the same for ms sql installation as well as a postgrad sql installation as well as a postgrad sql installation as well as a postgrad i have install creation in this install i have install creation in this install i have install creation in this install script that i will share with you and script that i will share with you and script that i will share with you and this is for postgre i'll probably give this is for postgre i'll probably give this is for postgre i'll probably give it a proper name it a proper name it a proper name and then i believe there is an install and then i believe there is an install and then i believe there is an install script for script for script for sql and you could tell that the sql is sql and you could tell that the sql is sql and you could tell that the sql is slightly slightly slightly different and this is just to make sure different and this is just to make sure different and this is just to make sure that i am now restoring the database that i am now restoring the database that i am now restoring the database with ms sql with ms sql with ms sql but the rest of the script is it but the rest of the script is it but the rest of the script is it actually exactly the same actually exactly the same actually exactly the same so let's proceed with the installation so let's proceed with the installation so let's proceed with the installation take a look at what's happening here take a look at what's happening here take a look at what's happening here creatio register we're going to create a creatio register we're going to create a creatio register we're going to create a web app we're going to go and web app we're going to go and web app we're going to go and update clio because i'm going to be update clio because i'm going to be update clio because i'm going to be using clio to make sure that i can using clio to make sure that i can using clio to make sure that i can connect connect connect to my application then inside my to my application then inside my to my application then inside my application i'm going to install clio application i'm going to install clio application i'm going to install clio gate gate gate then i'm going to use clio to turn off then i'm going to use clio to turn off then i'm going to use clio to turn off these widgets these widgets these widgets for news i'm going to overwrite a couple for news i'm going to overwrite a couple for news i'm going to overwrite a couple of other settings i'm going to set up my of other settings i'm going to set up my of other settings i'm going to set up my default time zone to a particular value default time zone to a particular value default time zone to a particular value i'm going to override the user session i'm going to override the user session i'm going to override the user session value etc and i'm going to go and value etc and i'm going to go and value etc and i'm going to go and reconfigure a bunch of stuff here all reconfigure a bunch of stuff here all reconfigure a bunch of stuff here all with the help of clio with the help of clio with the help of clio and then at the end as soon as the clio and then at the end as soon as the clio and then at the end as soon as the clio is done is done is done reconfiguring my application all i want reconfiguring my application all i want reconfiguring my application all i want to do is i want to make sure that to do is i want to make sure that to do is i want to make sure that i start the process and navigate to this i start the process and navigate to this i start the process and navigate to this host and port host and port host and port now the way i launch it is perhaps not now the way i launch it is perhaps not now the way i launch it is perhaps not the way that the way that the way that you would launch it normally but i just you would launch it normally but i just you would launch it normally but i just find it a little bit easier inside find it a little bit easier inside find it a little bit easier inside visual studio visual studio visual studio to do it this way so inside my visual to do it this way so inside my visual to do it this way so inside my visual studio studio studio in the launcher json what i have is i in the launcher json what i have is i in the launcher json what i have is i have couple of launch files here have couple of launch files here have couple of launch files here so if you go inside the visual studio so if you go inside the visual studio so if you go inside the visual studio debugger you will see that you can debugger you will see that you can debugger you will see that you can launch launch launch this powershell script with couple of this powershell script with couple of this powershell script with couple of configuration options configuration options configuration options install creation psql just regular install creation psql just regular install creation psql just regular powershell powershell powershell install creation with ms sql when i want install creation with ms sql when i want install creation with ms sql when i want to install creation with psql i have to to install creation with psql i have to to install creation with psql i have to address this section address this section address this section i have to specify the app name folder i have to specify the app name folder i have to specify the app name folder name where this stuff is stored name where this stuff is stored name where this stuff is stored i have to make sure that i specify i have to make sure that i specify i have to make sure that i specify username and password username and password username and password the port where it's going to live the the port where it's going to live the the port where it's going to live the database or redis database number as database or redis database number as database or redis database number as well as redisport well as redisport well as redisport and couple of other parameters and and couple of other parameters and and couple of other parameters and they're specific to my application they're specific to my application they're specific to my application so let's go ahead and do that we're so let's go ahead and do that we're so let's go ahead and do that we're going to give it a going to give it a going to give it a app name we're going to call it creatio app name we're going to call it creatio app name we're going to call it creatio studio studio studio now one thing that uh be careful of now one thing that uh be careful of now one thing that uh be careful of is for some reason i found that is for some reason i found that is for some reason i found that if i call through powershell scripts my if i call through powershell scripts my if i call through powershell scripts my database with the uppercase database with the uppercase database with the uppercase letters then something is not working letters then something is not working letters then something is not working correctly and the database correctly and the database correctly and the database is always created in either lowercase or is always created in either lowercase or is always created in either lowercase or uppercase and uppercase and uppercase and it's probably something to do with my it's probably something to do with my it's probably something to do with my script but i couldn't figure out it script but i couldn't figure out it script but i couldn't figure out it real quick so if you want to use this real quick so if you want to use this real quick so if you want to use this script and you want to use these launch script and you want to use these launch script and you want to use these launch parameters then just make sure that parameters then just make sure that parameters then just make sure that everything is in the lower case everything is in the lower case everything is in the lower case okay so folder name i will explain what okay so folder name i will explain what okay so folder name i will explain what that stuff is and how it works that stuff is and how it works that stuff is and how it works but we're going to specify that to but we're going to specify that to but we're going to specify that to connect to my redis database is going to connect to my redis database is going to connect to my redis database is going to be a supervisor the password is also be a supervisor the password is also be a supervisor the password is also supervisor supervisor supervisor let's put it on the port 7020 just to let's put it on the port 7020 just to let's put it on the port 7020 just to make sure it lives there and the make sure it lives there and the make sure it lives there and the uh ms application was installed on redis uh ms application was installed on redis uh ms application was installed on redis 15 so let's give this red is 14. 15 so let's give this red is 14. 15 so let's give this red is 14. my redis port is 63.79 my redis port is 63.79 my redis port is 63.79 and i'm using studio softkey and i'm using studio softkey and i'm using studio softkey backup file okay so now backup file okay so now backup file okay so now that i've configured my launcher that i've configured my launcher that i've configured my launcher essentially what the launcher file essentially what the launcher file essentially what the launcher file allows me to do is rather than allows me to do is rather than allows me to do is rather than typing this entire command by hand every typing this entire command by hand every typing this entire command by hand every time time time i can just simply now open my i can just simply now open my i can just simply now open my installation file and say installation file and say installation file and say apply these launcher settings okay and apply these launcher settings okay and apply these launcher settings okay and just simply go ahead and launch them just simply go ahead and launch them just simply go ahead and launch them it will start the powershell and visuals it will start the powershell and visuals it will start the powershell and visuals well not in visual studio but it will well not in visual studio but it will well not in visual studio but it will start an instance of my powershell and start an instance of my powershell and start an instance of my powershell and it will create me it will create me it will create me this application now what i realize is this application now what i realize is this application now what i realize is that i may have called my that i may have called my that i may have called my application pool and my website to application pool and my website to application pool and my website to very similar to what windows instance very similar to what windows instance very similar to what windows instance already has already has already has so it may or may not fail on me i didn't so it may or may not fail on me i didn't so it may or may not fail on me i didn't i didn't think of it but in the meantime i didn't think of it but in the meantime i didn't think of it but in the meantime while we're doing this or while visual while we're doing this or while visual while we're doing this or while visual studio is doing this and it's going to studio is doing this and it's going to studio is doing this and it's going to do it for a couple of minutes let's go do it for a couple of minutes let's go do it for a couple of minutes let's go and take a look how my infrastructure is and take a look how my infrastructure is and take a look how my infrastructure is laid out here laid out here laid out here so on my disk c when i built my so on my disk c when i built my so on my disk c when i built my docker files i've created couple of docker files i've created couple of docker files i've created couple of volumes volumes volumes i've got volumes that i'm passing to pg i've got volumes that i'm passing to pg i've got volumes that i'm passing to pg admin i've got volumes that i'm passing admin i've got volumes that i'm passing admin i've got volumes that i'm passing or or or disk space that i'm passing to disk space that i'm passing to disk space that i'm passing to postgresql postgresql postgresql and in postgrassclaw what you're seeing and in postgrassclaw what you're seeing and in postgrassclaw what you're seeing here is essentially what's on linux here is essentially what's on linux here is essentially what's on linux these files are called so this is inside these files are called so this is inside these files are called so this is inside the etsy directory and i don't remember the etsy directory and i don't remember the etsy directory and i don't remember the exact the exact the exact uh space uh the exact name of this uh space uh the exact name of this uh space uh the exact name of this directory but directory but directory but we got to look at the docker compose we got to look at the docker compose we got to look at the docker compose file so i'm passing it and essentially file so i'm passing it and essentially file so i'm passing it and essentially i can take a backup of this directory i can take a backup of this directory i can take a backup of this directory and this would represent backup of my and this would represent backup of my and this would represent backup of my entire server entire server entire server i've created myself files called db i've created myself files called db i've created myself files called db images images images db images are files that i'm using to db images are files that i'm using to db images are files that i'm using to restore my database restore my database restore my database just like in windows application you had just like in windows application you had just like in windows application you had a db folder a db folder a db folder when you're going to download a when you're going to download a when you're going to download a postgraph postgraph postgraph when you're going to download a postgrad when you're going to download a postgrad when you're going to download a postgrad file there's also going to be a db file there's also going to be a db file there's also going to be a db file now this db file is going to be file now this db file is going to be file now this db file is going to be obviously in different format and called obviously in different format and called obviously in different format and called something something something different so what i did is i essentially different so what i did is i essentially different so what i did is i essentially copied them all because i only need one copied them all because i only need one copied them all because i only need one per type of the application so if i want per type of the application so if i want per type of the application so if i want a studio a studio a studio it is always going to be the same backup it is always going to be the same backup it is always going to be the same backup file if i want a file if i want a file if i want a full bundle then it's also going to be full bundle then it's also going to be full bundle then it's also going to be exactly the same file for bundle so exactly the same file for bundle so exactly the same file for bundle so i just simply copied them and pre-copied i just simply copied them and pre-copied i just simply copied them and pre-copied them so i don't have to make sure that them so i don't have to make sure that them so i don't have to make sure that i'm copying the entire thing just kind i'm copying the entire thing just kind i'm copying the entire thing just kind of speeds things up a little bit of speeds things up a little bit of speeds things up a little bit so this is what this file name is okay so this is what this file name is okay so this is what this file name is okay now let's go back into our studio and now let's go back into our studio and now let's go back into our studio and take a look at what the studio is doing take a look at what the studio is doing take a look at what the studio is doing now now now so powershell is now trying to restore so powershell is now trying to restore so powershell is now trying to restore database and it essentially gotten to database and it essentially gotten to database and it essentially gotten to this point this point this point it gotten to a point of here creating it gotten to a point of here creating it gotten to a point of here creating the the the database right so it probably already database right so it probably already database right so it probably already created this process takes created this process takes created this process takes no time at all um this is really really no time at all um this is really really no time at all um this is really really fast and inexpensive fast and inexpensive fast and inexpensive but this takes some time so but this takes some time so but this takes some time so what are we doing here well the first what are we doing here well the first what are we doing here well the first thing when you're restoring a database thing when you're restoring a database thing when you're restoring a database is you need to create it now in ms is you need to create it now in ms is you need to create it now in ms we didn't have to do it but in postgre we didn't have to do it but in postgre we didn't have to do it but in postgre you first have to create a database give you first have to create a database give you first have to create a database give it a name it a name it a name specify some of the parameters and then specify some of the parameters and then specify some of the parameters and then you need to make sure that you're you need to make sure that you're you need to make sure that you're restoring it restoring it restoring it now granted that it's done that it's now granted that it's done that it's now granted that it's done that it's living in the docker so it's living living in the docker so it's living living in the docker so it's living inside this kind of a inside this kind of a inside this kind of a isolated environment we have to use a isolated environment we have to use a isolated environment we have to use a docker exact command out of the docker exact command out of the docker exact command out of the powershell to restore it now there are powershell to restore it now there are powershell to restore it now there are other ways but i found that this is the other ways but i found that this is the other ways but i found that this is the easiest to get it going easiest to get it going easiest to get it going so all i'm saying here is docker go and so all i'm saying here is docker go and so all i'm saying here is docker go and execute some command in interactive mode execute some command in interactive mode execute some command in interactive mode i am addressing the container where my i am addressing the container where my i am addressing the container where my particular database lives particular database lives particular database lives i'm specifying the username or i'm specifying the username or i'm specifying the username or basically parameters how to restore it basically parameters how to restore it basically parameters how to restore it i'm saying no owner no privileges i'm saying no owner no privileges i'm saying no owner no privileges a couple of other keys and essentially a couple of other keys and essentially a couple of other keys and essentially here's my database here's my database here's my database name now where am i going to take this name now where am i going to take this name now where am i going to take this database name i'm going to take it yeah database name i'm going to take it yeah database name i'm going to take it yeah i'm going to take it from usr local db i'm going to take it from usr local db i'm going to take it from usr local db db file name now what we saw now is that db file name now what we saw now is that db file name now what we saw now is that i made a mistake and when i restored the i made a mistake and when i restored the i made a mistake and when i restored the database database database or when i gave the parameters to launch or when i gave the parameters to launch or when i gave the parameters to launch is i did not specify a unique name for is i did not specify a unique name for is i did not specify a unique name for my application server my application server my application server so this application server creation so this application server creation so this application server creation creation studio already exists creation studio already exists creation studio already exists so what we can do is say creatio studio so what we can do is say creatio studio so what we can do is say creatio studio p sql right so now that's going to be a p sql right so now that's going to be a p sql right so now that's going to be a unique name unique name unique name i just make sure we give it another i just make sure we give it another i just make sure we give it another i just for now i'll clean it up later i just for now i'll clean it up later i just for now i'll clean it up later but let's make sure that we do this but let's make sure that we do this but let's make sure that we do this 70 30. okay let's save this 70 30. okay let's save this 70 30. okay let's save this and let's try launching it one more time and let's try launching it one more time and let's try launching it one more time so the same way so the same way so the same way psql so now the name of my application psql so now the name of my application psql so now the name of my application the name of my uh the name of my uh the name of my uh the name of everything is essentially the name of everything is essentially the name of everything is essentially unique i unique i unique i cannot debug until the cannot debug until the cannot debug until the what until what until what until has started okay so i crashed the has started okay so i crashed the has started okay so i crashed the powershell powershell powershell so let's start a new one and let's see so let's start a new one and let's see so let's start a new one and let's see if you can launch if you can launch if you can launch in noaa in noaa in noaa okay let's see if we can add another okay let's see if we can add another okay let's see if we can add another instance of it instance of it instance of it can you launch now um okay let's close um okay let's close this one and let's reopen our studio one this one and let's reopen our studio one this one and let's reopen our studio one more time so more time so more time so sometimes this happens and that was my sometimes this happens and that was my sometimes this happens and that was my fault fault fault so back to where we were let's go back so back to where we were let's go back so back to where we were let's go back to to to installer let's go back to debugger and installer let's go back to debugger and installer let's go back to debugger and just simply just simply just simply launch it okay so now it's copying it to launch it okay so now it's copying it to launch it okay so now it's copying it to creation creation creation psql and what we can do is we can psql and what we can do is we can psql and what we can do is we can essentially go back to our essentially go back to our essentially go back to our local disk c and we can take a look at local disk c and we can take a look at local disk c and we can take a look at what was what was what was happening in the past so if we're going happening in the past so if we're going happening in the past so if we're going to go back to inet pub to go back to inet pub to go back to inet pub and we're going to go back in the root and we're going to go back in the root and we're going to go back in the root application you could tell that here's application you could tell that here's application you could tell that here's my creation studio my creation studio my creation studio and i just essentially copied everything and i just essentially copied everything and i just essentially copied everything into one directory so i made a into one directory so i made a into one directory so i made a i made a mistake here so a few things i made a mistake here so a few things i made a mistake here so a few things that i need to do that i need to do that i need to do when i am removing the application the when i am removing the application the when i am removing the application the first thing i would normally start off first thing i would normally start off first thing i would normally start off with with with is i'm going to go back to my ms into my is i'm going to go back to my ms into my is i'm going to go back to my ms into my iis iis iis inside my ass i could tell here's my inside my ass i could tell here's my inside my ass i could tell here's my creation studio creation studio creation studio and inside this creation studio i can and inside this creation studio i can and inside this creation studio i can just simply just simply just simply delete this thing i can right click on delete this thing i can right click on delete this thing i can right click on it and i can delete it it and i can delete it it and i can delete it if a machine allows me but before i if a machine allows me but before i if a machine allows me but before i delete it delete it delete it yes i'm sure i want to delete it yes i'm sure i want to delete it yes i'm sure i want to delete it before you delete it make sure that before you delete it make sure that before you delete it make sure that you're deleting actually the right one you're deleting actually the right one you're deleting actually the right one you might have a ton of applications you might have a ton of applications you might have a ton of applications here and now we're ready to come back here and now we're ready to come back here and now we're ready to come back here to creation studio application pool here to creation studio application pool here to creation studio application pool and delete this thing as well and delete this thing as well and delete this thing as well so let's remove this one as well now so let's remove this one as well now so let's remove this one as well now everything is everything is everything is fine here but um what you need to know fine here but um what you need to know fine here but um what you need to know about about about is that under your users directory is that under your users directory is that under your users directory usually usually usually depending on how your machine is depending on how your machine is depending on how your machine is configured you may also get an configured you may also get an configured you may also get an application application application you may also get a directory for your you may also get a directory for your you may also get a directory for your user for every application pool user for every application pool user for every application pool so the way my machine is configured in so the way my machine is configured in so the way my machine is configured in particular particular particular every time i'm adding in the app pool it every time i'm adding in the app pool it every time i'm adding in the app pool it creates a directory for this user creates a directory for this user creates a directory for this user and then happens to be about 200 and then happens to be about 200 and then happens to be about 200 megabytes or maybe even 500 megabytes if megabytes or maybe even 500 megabytes if megabytes or maybe even 500 megabytes if i'm whoa that's huge actually i'm whoa that's huge actually i'm whoa that's huge actually so what you may want to do is you want so what you may want to do is you want so what you may want to do is you want to make sure to make sure to make sure that when you're deleting the that when you're deleting the that when you're deleting the application that application that application that things are simply dis that you're things are simply dis that you're things are simply dis that you're deleting them deleting them deleting them if you install it 10 or 15 times i mean if you install it 10 or 15 times i mean if you install it 10 or 15 times i mean 5 gigs is not that much 5 gigs is not that much 5 gigs is not that much but what you may want to make sure off but what you may want to make sure off but what you may want to make sure off is that you actually go and delete it is that you actually go and delete it is that you actually go and delete it right because this is junk right now right because this is junk right now right because this is junk right now this user doesn't exist this user doesn't exist this user doesn't exist it was created for us when it was created for us when it was created for us when the application was added and now we the application was added and now we the application was added and now we just cleaned up and just cleaned up and just cleaned up and now everything is fine now don't delete now everything is fine now don't delete now everything is fine now don't delete too much too much too much this is my actual user don't delete this is my actual user don't delete this is my actual user don't delete temps and temps and temps and these might be actually useful for you these might be actually useful for you these might be actually useful for you just make sure that you only delete just make sure that you only delete just make sure that you only delete things that things that things that you want to delete okay there is nothing you want to delete okay there is nothing you want to delete okay there is nothing else to do else to do else to do um the other thing that we may want to um the other thing that we may want to um the other thing that we may want to do is we may want to do is we may want to do is we may want to uh just free up a few resources so we're uh just free up a few resources so we're uh just free up a few resources so we're going to go to going to go to going to go to sql service and since i'm not using a ms sql service and since i'm not using a ms sql service and since i'm not using a ms sql sql sql on my local environment i'm going to go on my local environment i'm going to go on my local environment i'm going to go and and and stop this application here stop this application here stop this application here so let's search for sql so let's search for sql so let's search for sql sql server and i can just simply stop it sql server and i can just simply stop it sql server and i can just simply stop it i no longer want to use it and i believe i no longer want to use it and i believe i no longer want to use it and i believe this one agent is also running this one agent is also running this one agent is also running this will free up maybe i don't know this will free up maybe i don't know this will free up maybe i don't know half a gig of ram half a gig of ram half a gig of ram uh not much but if you're on limited uh not much but if you're on limited uh not much but if you're on limited resources that that might actually resources that that might actually resources that that might actually make significant changes okay so now you make significant changes okay so now you make significant changes okay so now you could tell that here's my creation could tell that here's my creation could tell that here's my creation studio psql so this is the studio psql so this is the studio psql so this is the one that is being installed but then one that is being installed but then one that is being installed but then this this this creation studio we can just simply nuke creation studio we can just simply nuke creation studio we can just simply nuke this this this directory so the previous one that we directory so the previous one that we directory so the previous one that we used for used for used for microsoft windows now let's take a look microsoft windows now let's take a look microsoft windows now let's take a look at the application what the script is at the application what the script is at the application what the script is doing now doing now doing now um so created new app pool environment um so created new app pool environment um so created new app pool environment uh was configured try logging in so it's uh was configured try logging in so it's uh was configured try logging in so it's trying to log in right now with the trying to log in right now with the trying to log in right now with the creation creation creation permissions by with the help of clio permissions by with the help of clio permissions by with the help of clio somewhere here we'll see that the clio somewhere here we'll see that the clio somewhere here we'll see that the clio is being is being is being checked or updated checked or updated checked or updated so clio is trying to uh here create clio so clio is trying to uh here create clio so clio is trying to uh here create clio was reinstalled to the latest was reinstalled to the latest was reinstalled to the latest version clio is our command line version clio is our command line version clio is our command line interface interface interface now the first time you're trying to now the first time you're trying to now the first time you're trying to connect to clear this will take some connect to clear this will take some connect to clear this will take some time time time and that's because well the application and that's because well the application and that's because well the application actually needs to start actually needs to start actually needs to start um start something and as soon as the um start something and as soon as the um start something and as soon as the clio clio clio was able to connect it's going to try to was able to connect it's going to try to was able to connect it's going to try to install install install a clio gate automatically a clio gate automatically a clio gate automatically cleargate is the api extension that cleargate is the api extension that cleargate is the api extension that allows us to perform things such as allows us to perform things such as allows us to perform things such as setting up setting up setting up configuration settings installing configuration settings installing configuration settings installing packages and things of that nature packages and things of that nature packages and things of that nature specifying your cultures configuring specifying your cultures configuring specifying your cultures configuring many many different things many many different things many many different things and essentially everything and anything and essentially everything and anything and essentially everything and anything and everything about creation can be and everything about creation can be and everything about creation can be done done done with clio so sometimes you'll see the with clio so sometimes you'll see the with clio so sometimes you'll see the remote server return errors that's remote server return errors that's remote server return errors that's that's fine um all we're doing now is that's fine um all we're doing now is that's fine um all we're doing now is we're configuring system we're configuring system we're configuring system settings you could see that they're all settings you could see that they're all settings you could see that they're all being updated i'm being updated i'm being updated i'm turning things on and turning things off turning things on and turning things off turning things on and turning things off i am installing i am installing i am installing setting myself to debug mode and then at setting myself to debug mode and then at setting myself to debug mode and then at this point this point this point my application is completed my application is completed my application is completed i'm gonna try to log on with the i'm gonna try to log on with the i'm gonna try to log on with the supervisor supervisor supervisor supervisor i'm logging on you could tell supervisor i'm logging on you could tell supervisor i'm logging on you could tell that there is no more this that there is no more this that there is no more this widget that tells me things about the widget that tells me things about the widget that tells me things about the news anymore news anymore news anymore so that's gone and there are going to be so that's gone and there are going to be so that's gone and there are going to be a couple of other notable differences a couple of other notable differences a couple of other notable differences as soon as my application is installed as soon as my application is installed as soon as my application is installed you see it's in the debug mode you see it's in the debug mode you see it's in the debug mode if i go into my profile you will also if i go into my profile you will also if i go into my profile you will also see that see that see that i have my language configured for myself i have my language configured for myself i have my language configured for myself as well as the default time zone for all as well as the default time zone for all as well as the default time zone for all users users users now all i have to do is just simply now all i have to do is just simply now all i have to do is just simply choose my date time format if i so choose my date time format if i so choose my date time format if i so choose choose choose and my time zone but i'm happy with the and my time zone but i'm happy with the and my time zone but i'm happy with the default configurations that default configurations that default configurations that that are applied so essentially at this that are applied so essentially at this that are applied so essentially at this point everything is configured point everything is configured point everything is configured as well as the exchange listener so if as well as the exchange listener so if as well as the exchange listener so if we wanted to simply go we wanted to simply go we wanted to simply go and let's see if we can add and let's see if we can add and let's see if we can add an email really quickly so let's go into go to mailbox settings so let's go into go to mailbox settings let's create a mailbox and i'm going to let's create a mailbox and i'm going to let's create a mailbox and i'm going to add add add my work email my work email my work email and that's going to be office 365. i'm going to provide my username and i'm going to provide my username and password password password and if everything is installed correctly and if everything is installed correctly and if everything is installed correctly then i should be able to connect then i should be able to connect then i should be able to connect perfect uh it's been successfully added perfect uh it's been successfully added perfect uh it's been successfully added so now i know my exchange listener so now i know my exchange listener so now i know my exchange listener is also connected to this instance and is also connected to this instance and is also connected to this instance and i'm going to go and immediately i'm going to go and immediately i'm going to go and immediately change my settings as i do not wish for change my settings as i do not wish for change my settings as i do not wish for any emails to be downloaded any emails to be downloaded any emails to be downloaded right so you can just go ahead and right so you can just go ahead and right so you can just go ahead and configure email or go configure email or go configure email or go through the exchange listener through the exchange listener through the exchange listener configuration so configuration so configuration so this is essentially how you would this is essentially how you would this is essentially how you would configure configure configure creatio to run for the first time creatio to run for the first time creatio to run for the first time on the new instance of the application on the new instance of the application on the new instance of the application now just for good measure now just for good measure now just for good measure since we're in the debug mode already since we're in the debug mode already since we're in the debug mode already let's click on this button let's click on this button let's click on this button let's make sure that we can also perform let's make sure that we can also perform let's make sure that we can also perform this step to recompile our application this step to recompile our application this step to recompile our application just to make sure that nothing is broken just to make sure that nothing is broken just to make sure that nothing is broken and if application compiles and if application compiles and if application compiles installs and compiles and we know installs and compiles and we know installs and compiles and we know everything has been everything has been everything has been installed successfully so let's give it installed successfully so let's give it installed successfully so let's give it a a a let's give it a moment hopefully it's let's give it a moment hopefully it's let's give it a moment hopefully it's not going to be too long in terms of performance if you're in terms of performance if you're wondering what's faster wondering what's faster wondering what's faster running it in windows with ms running it running it in windows with ms running it running it in windows with ms running it on windows on windows on windows with postgrain docker postgre natively with postgrain docker postgre natively with postgrain docker postgre natively installed on windows installed on windows installed on windows um perhaps i'm not the best judge um perhaps i'm not the best judge um perhaps i'm not the best judge uh i can't tell you uh what's faster uh i can't tell you uh what's faster uh i can't tell you uh what's faster what's better what's better what's better i found that it's just as lightning fast i found that it's just as lightning fast i found that it's just as lightning fast in one uh technology as it is with the in one uh technology as it is with the in one uh technology as it is with the other other other i honestly did not find any differences i honestly did not find any differences i honestly did not find any differences operation operation operation is successful so i know my creatio is uh is successful so i know my creatio is uh is successful so i know my creatio is uh perfectly installed now i'm talking perfectly installed now i'm talking perfectly installed now i'm talking close this thing close this thing close this thing and i am i can go back to my let's say and i am i can go back to my let's say and i am i can go back to my let's say to my pg admin and just to make sure to my pg admin and just to make sure to my pg admin and just to make sure that i can connect to my database just that i can connect to my database just that i can connect to my database just to kind of to kind of to kind of give it a quick look so what you will give it a quick look so what you will give it a quick look so what you will see here is that we've got this see here is that we've got this see here is that we've got this postgresql now postgresql now postgresql now here's my postgresql and here's my here's my postgresql and here's my here's my postgresql and here's my previous attempt previous attempt previous attempt that has failed the database didn't that has failed the database didn't that has failed the database didn't actually fail to restore but we failed actually fail to restore but we failed actually fail to restore but we failed to to to create ies and the pool so what i can create ies and the pool so what i can create ies and the pool so what i can just simply do here is i can delete this just simply do here is i can delete this just simply do here is i can delete this or drop this database it's going to ask or drop this database it's going to ask or drop this database it's going to ask me if i'm sure me if i'm sure me if i'm sure i say i am and it's going to go and i say i am and it's going to go and i say i am and it's going to go and delete it now the delete it now the delete it now the web ui for pg admin is not as web ui for pg admin is not as web ui for pg admin is not as refined as let's say a native refined as let's say a native refined as let's say a native application such as application such as application such as sql studio but it's good enough it's sql studio but it's good enough it's sql studio but it's good enough it's definitely good enough to perform most definitely good enough to perform most definitely good enough to perform most of the common tasks of the common tasks of the common tasks if i want to go now inside let's say my if i want to go now inside let's say my if i want to go now inside let's say my schemas schemas schemas i want to go to my public and i want to i want to go to my public and i want to i want to go to my public and i want to go into my tables go into my tables go into my tables here's a list of all the tables and it here's a list of all the tables and it here's a list of all the tables and it gives you all the same features gives you all the same features gives you all the same features as before you've got here under uh tools as before you've got here under uh tools as before you've got here under uh tools i believe i believe i believe uh query tool and from the query tool uh query tool and from the query tool uh query tool and from the query tool you can you can you can query whatever you want so let's just query whatever you want so let's just query whatever you want so let's just say that we want to query something say that we want to query something say that we want to query something select id from select id from select id from and i believe it's called public dot um and i believe it's called public dot um and i believe it's called public dot um contact if i'm not mistaken uh id i think uh id i think everything needs to be in single quotes everything needs to be in single quotes everything needs to be in single quotes here here here i think from public i think from public i think from public contact that's weird contact that's weird contact that's weird select id from public contact that's uh that looks public contact that's uh that looks right right right uh maybe i need that oh no hold on it uh maybe i need that oh no hold on it uh maybe i need that oh no hold on it needs to be double quotes needs to be double quotes needs to be double quotes right double or single well whichever right double or single well whichever right double or single well whichever way way way uh i don't spend a lot of time here uh i don't spend a lot of time here uh i don't spend a lot of time here select id okay so there we go so everything needs okay so there we go so everything needs to be escaped with double quotes to be escaped with double quotes to be escaped with double quotes um so this is kind of unfortunate way of um so this is kind of unfortunate way of um so this is kind of unfortunate way of that we need to address p sql but that we need to address p sql but that we need to address p sql but this is the only difference that this is the only difference that this is the only difference that probably you're going to care about probably you're going to care about probably you're going to care about if you get to work with psql and most of if you get to work with psql and most of if you get to work with psql and most of the time when you're doing development the time when you're doing development the time when you're doing development you you you quite honestly don't care all right so quite honestly don't care all right so quite honestly don't care all right so um um um this concludes our this concludes our this concludes our this concludes our session for today for this concludes our session for today for this concludes our session for today for how to install how to install how to install creation i will provide you with all the creation i will provide you with all the creation i will provide you with all the necessary files for necessary files for necessary files for installing creation with the help of a installing creation with the help of a installing creation with the help of a script and i will provide you with the script and i will provide you with the script and i will provide you with the docker compose files that you can docker compose files that you can docker compose files that you can let's say resurrect the environment if let's say resurrect the environment if let's say resurrect the environment if you so choose and then just simply use you so choose and then just simply use you so choose and then just simply use my files my files my files if you want to see how it's done i'll if you want to see how it's done i'll if you want to see how it's done i'll provide you with two options with the provide you with two options with the provide you with two options with the option for option for option for microsoft sql as well as postgrad if you microsoft sql as well as postgrad if you microsoft sql as well as postgrad if you have any questions as usual have any questions as usual have any questions as usual please raise an issue on the github please raise an issue on the github please raise an issue on the github repository where all the files are going repository where all the files are going repository where all the files are going to be posted to be posted to be posted and i will try to help you out as much and i will try to help you out as much and i will try to help you out as much as possible so thank you very much and as possible so thank you very much and as possible so thank you very much and i'll see you i'll see you i'll see you next time in the next episode is going next time in the next episode is going next time in the next episode is going to be dedicated to to be dedicated to to be dedicated to working with integrations working with integrations working with integrations and we're still going to do a little bit and we're still going to do a little bit and we're still going to do a little bit of infrastructure we're going to have to of infrastructure we're going to have to of infrastructure we're going to have to install install install an additional component uh called an additional component uh called an additional component uh called identity service identity service identity service and then we're going to try to use and then we're going to try to use and then we're going to try to use identity service to authenticate identity service to authenticate identity service to authenticate ourselves ourselves ourselves and to exchange some data with creation and to exchange some data with creation and to exchange some data with creation so see you on the next episode thanks",
