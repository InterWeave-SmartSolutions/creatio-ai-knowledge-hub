## ðŸ“‹ Installation Files Status

### What You Need to Complete the Setup:

The only missing component is the **Creatio installation files**. You need to:

1. **Obtain Creatio Files**: Contact Creatio support for the Linux installation
   package
2. **Extract Files**: Place the extracted files in
   `/home/andrewwork/creatio-local/application/`
3. **Start Environment**: Run `./start-creatio.sh` from the creatio-local
   directory

### Two Installation Approaches Available:

#### Option 1: Windows IIS Deployment

- Complete guide created at:
  `creatio-installation/docs/COMPLETE_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`
- PowerShell scripts available at: `creatio-installation/scripts/`
- Requires Windows Pro with IIS, SQL Server, and Redis for Windows

#### Option 2: Linux Deployment (Completed) âœ…

- Environment fully configured and ready
- Uses PostgreSQL + Redis + Docker
- Located at: `/home/andrewwork/creatio-local/`

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Get Installation Files**: Contact Creatio support for Linux package
2. **Extract to Application Directory**:

   ```bash
   # Extract your Creatio files to:
   /home/andrewwork/creatio-local/application/
   ```

3. **Start the Environment**:

   ```bash
   cd /home/andrewwork/creatio-local
   ./start-creatio.sh
   ```

4. **Access Creatio**:
   - HTTP: `http://localhost:5000`
   - HTTPS: `https://localhost:5002`
   - Default login: `Supervisor` / `Supervisor`

### Development Workflow:

1. **Enable File System Mode**: Go to System Designer â†’ Advanced Settings
2. **Download Packages**: Actions â†’ "Download packages to file system"
3. **Configure IDE**: Point to application directory for development
4. **Use Clio**: For package management and deployment

## ðŸ”§ Current Environment Status

### Services Running:

- âœ… PostgreSQL: Database server active
- âœ… Redis: Cache server active and responding
- âœ… Docker: Container runtime ready
- âœ… .NET 8: Application runtime available

### Ready for:

- âœ… Creatio application deployment
- âœ… File system development mode
- âœ… Package-based development
- âœ… Git integration
- âœ… IDE integration (VS Code, Visual Studio, Rider)

## ðŸ“ž Support

### Documentation Available:

- **Linux Setup**: `/home/andrewwork/creatio-local/README.md`
- **Windows Setup**: `creatio-installation/docs/COMPLETE_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`
- **Developer Course**: `documentation/developer-course/processed/transcripts/`

### Troubleshooting:

- Check service status: `docker-compose ps`
- View logs: `docker-compose logs -f creatio`
- Database connection: Connection strings configured for PostgreSQL
- Redis connection: Configured for localhost:6379
