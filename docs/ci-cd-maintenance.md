## Pipeline Architecture

### GitHub Actions Pipeline

The primary CI/CD pipeline runs on GitHub Actions with the following stages:

1. **Code Quality & Security**
   - Code formatting (Black)
   - Import sorting (isort)
   - Linting (flake8)
   - Type checking (mypy)
   - Security scanning (bandit)

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests (pytest)
   - Integration tests
   - Coverage reporting
   - Performance tests (Locust)

3. **Building**
   - Docker image building
   - Multi-architecture builds (amd64, arm64)
   - Image tagging and pushing

4. **Security Scanning**
   - Container vulnerability scanning (Trivy)
   - SARIF report generation

5. **Deployment**
   - Staging deployment (develop branch)
   - Production deployment (releases)
   - Smoke tests

### Azure DevOps Pipeline (Alternative)

The Azure DevOps pipeline provides similar functionality with Azure-specific integrations:

- Azure Container Registry integration
- Azure Web App deployments
- Azure Key Vault for secrets management

## Maintenance Tasks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Build Failures

**Issue**: Dependency installation failures
```bash
# Solution: Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf ~/.cache/pip
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

**Issue**: Docker build timeouts
```bash
# Solution: Optimize Dockerfile and use multi-stage builds
# Increase timeout in pipeline configuration
timeout-minutes: 30
```

**Issue**: Test failures in CI but not locally
```bash
# Check for environment differences
# Ensure consistent Python versions
# Review test isolation
# Check for race conditions
```

#### Deployment Issues

**Issue**: Deployment hangs or times out
```bash
# Check resource availability
# Review deployment logs
# Verify health check endpoints
# Check network connectivity
```

**Issue**: Database migration failures
```bash
# Review migration scripts
# Check database permissions
# Verify backup before migration
# Test migration in staging first
```

#### Security Scan Issues

**Issue**: False positive vulnerabilities
```bash
# Add to allowlist in security configuration
# trivy:
#   ignore-unfixed: true
#   severity: HIGH,CRITICAL
#   ignore-policy: .trivyignore
```

**Issue**: Secrets detection errors
```bash
# Review and rotate flagged secrets
# Update secret scanning configuration
# Add exclusions for test data
```

### Debugging Pipeline Issues

#### Workflow Debugging
```yaml
# Add debug steps to workflows
- name: Debug Environment
  run: |
    echo "GitHub Context:"
    echo "${{ toJson(github) }}"
    echo "Environment Variables:"
    env | sort
```

#### Container Debugging
```bash
# Debug failed Docker builds
docker build --no-cache --progress=plain .

# Run container interactively
docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash image_name

# Check container logs
docker logs container_id
```

#### Test Debugging
```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v --tb=long --capture=no

# Run specific failing test
pytest tests/path/to/test.py::test_function -v

# Generate test report
pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html
```

## Security Maintenance

### Secret Management

#### Rotation Schedule
- API keys: Every 90 days
- Database passwords: Every 180 days
- SSL certificates: Before expiration
- SSH keys: Every 365 days

#### Secret Rotation Process
```bash
# Example script for secret rotation
#!/bin/bash
rotate_secret() {
    local secret_name=$1
    local new_value=$2
    
    # Update in key vault
    az keyvault secret set --vault-name "$VAULT_NAME" \
        --name "$secret_name" --value "$new_value"
    
    # Update GitHub secrets
    gh secret set "$secret_name" --body "$new_value"
    
    # Trigger deployment with new secret
    gh workflow run deploy.yml
}
```

#### Security Scanning Configuration

**Trivy Configuration** (`.trivyignore`):
```
# Ignore specific vulnerabilities with justification
CVE-2023-12345  # False positive in development dependencies
```

**Bandit Configuration** (`bandit.yaml`):
```yaml
skips: ['B101']  # Skip test-related assert statements
exclude_dirs: ['tests', 'venv']
```

### Compliance and Auditing

#### Regular Security Reviews
- Quarterly access reviews
- Annual penetration testing
- Compliance audit preparation
- Security policy updates

#### Audit Logging
```yaml
# Enable audit logging in workflows
- name: Audit Log
  run: |
    echo "Pipeline execution: ${{ github.run_id }}" >> audit.log
    echo "User: ${{ github.actor }}" >> audit.log
    echo "Timestamp: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" >> audit.log
```

## Performance Optimization

### Build Performance

#### Caching Strategies
```yaml
# Optimize caching in GitHub Actions
- name: Cache dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.cache/pip
      ~/.cache/docker
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
```

#### Parallel Execution
```yaml
# Use matrix builds for parallel testing
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: ['3.9', '3.10', '3.11']
    test-group: ['unit', 'integration', 'performance']
```

### Resource Optimization

#### Docker Image Optimization
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage builds to reduce image size
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
# Build dependencies
FROM python:3.11-slim as runtime
# Runtime only
```

#### Test Optimization
```bash
# Run tests in parallel
pytest -n auto --dist worksteal

# Skip slow tests in quick checks
pytest -m "not slow"

# Use test markers for selective execution
pytest -m "unit and not integration"
```

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategies

#### Pipeline Configuration Backup
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Backup pipeline configurations
backup_dir="backups/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$backup_dir"

# Backup GitHub workflows
cp -r .github/workflows "$backup_dir/"

# Backup configuration files
cp -r config "$backup_dir/"

# Backup scripts
cp -r scripts "$backup_dir/"

# Create archive
tar -czf "pipeline-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz" "$backup_dir"
```

#### Database and Application Backup
```bash
# Automated backup script
#!/bin/bash
backup_database() {
    local timestamp=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
    local backup_file="db_backup_$timestamp.sql"
    
    # Create database backup
    sqlite3 ai_knowledge_hub/knowledge_hub.db ".backup $backup_file"
    
    # Compress and upload to storage
    gzip "$backup_file"
    aws s3 cp "$backup_file.gz" "s3://$BACKUP_BUCKET/database/"
    
    # Clean up local files older than 7 days
    find . -name "db_backup_*.sql.gz" -mtime +7 -delete
}
```

### Recovery Procedures

#### Pipeline Recovery
1. **Identify the Issue**
   - Check pipeline status
   - Review error logs
   - Identify affected components

2. **Immediate Response**
   - Stop affected deployments
   - Rollback if necessary
   - Notify stakeholders

3. **Recovery Actions**
   - Restore from backups if needed
   - Fix identified issues
   - Test recovery in staging
   - Deploy fixes to production

4. **Post-Incident Review**
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update procedures
   - Implement preventive measures

#### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Quick rollback script
#!/bin/bash
rollback_deployment() {
    local environment=$1
    local previous_version=$2
    
    echo "Rolling back $environment to version $previous_version"
    
    # Pull previous image
    docker pull "$REGISTRY/$IMAGE:$previous_version"
    
    # Update deployment
    docker-compose -f "docker-compose.$environment.yml" \
        up -d --no-deps app
    
    # Verify rollback
    ./scripts/smoke-tests.sh "$environment"
}
```
