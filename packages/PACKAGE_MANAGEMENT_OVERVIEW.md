## 🛠️ Management Scripts

### Package Download Automation

#### Node.js/JavaScript
```bash
# Download single package
node packages/scripts/download-packages.js download lodash latest npm

# Batch download from file
node packages/scripts/download-packages.js batch package-list.json

# Clean expired cache
node packages/scripts/download-packages.js clean
```

#### Python
```bash
# Download Python package
python3 packages/scripts/download-packages.py download requests latest pypi

# Install from requirements
python3 packages/scripts/download-packages.py install requirements.txt

# Generate locked requirements
python3 packages/scripts/download-packages.py freeze requirements.lock
```

### Dependency Tracking
```bash
# Analyze dependencies
node packages/scripts/dependency-tracker.js analyze

# Generate security report
node packages/scripts/dependency-tracker.js security

# Clean unused dependencies
node packages/scripts/dependency-tracker.js cleanup 30

# Export dependency graph
node packages/scripts/dependency-tracker.js export json
```

### Deployment

#### Development Environment
```bash
# Deploy development environment
./packages/deploy/scripts/deploy-dev.sh

# Use development shortcuts
./package-dev.sh download express latest npm
./package-dev.sh track
./package-dev.sh clean
```

#### Production Environment
```bash
# Deploy production environment
./packages/deploy/scripts/deploy-prod.sh

# Production management
./package-prod.sh status
./package-prod.sh audit
./package-prod.sh monitor
./package-prod.sh backup
```

2. **Signature Verification**: Digital signature validation in production
3. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated security audits
4. **Access Control**: Restrictive file permissions in production
5. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all operations
6. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against excessive downloads

### Security Policies
- All registry connections use HTTPS
- Regular automated security audits
- Vulnerability alerts for critical issues
- No development dependencies in production
- Secure configuration file permissions

## 📈 Monitoring and Logging

### Log Files
- `packages/logs/package-manager.log`: Main application logs
- `packages/logs/security-audit.log`: Security audit results
- `packages/logs/monitoring.log`: System monitoring data

### Automated Monitoring
- **Daily security audits** at 2:00 AM
- **Disk usage monitoring** with alerts
- **Cache size tracking** and cleanup
- **Failed download detection**
- **Performance metrics** collection

## 🔄 Package Versioning Strategy

Following **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**:
- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** format
- **Pre-release identifiers**: `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`
- **Build metadata**: `+20240101` for traceability
- **Backwards compatibility** guidelines
- **Automated version management** through CI/CD

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Package Download Failures**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify registry availability
   - Review rate limiting settings

2. **Security Audit Failures**
   - Update vulnerable packages
   - Review security policies
   - Check file permissions

3. **Cache Issues**
   - Run cache cleanup: `./package-prod.sh clean`
   - Check disk space availability
   - Verify cache TTL settings

4. **Permission Errors**
   - Re-run deployment script
   - Manually set permissions: `chmod 755 packages/`
   - Check user access rights

### Emergency Procedures

1. **System Compromise**
   - Run immediate security audit
   - Review all log files
   - Update all packages
   - Restore from backup if needed

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Check system resources
   - Clean package cache
   - Review monitoring logs
   - Restart services if necessary

## 📝 Best Practices

### Development
1. **Use development shortcuts** for quick package management
2. **Regularly track dependencies** to avoid conflicts
3. **Keep cache clean** to save disk space
4. **Test in staging** before production deployment

2. **Monitor system resources** and performance
3. **Backup configurations** and local packages
4. **Keep logs for compliance** and troubleshooting

### Package Management
1. **Follow semantic versioning** for all packages
2. **Document dependencies** and their purposes  
3. **Use locked versions** in production
4. **Regular cleanup** of unused packages
